102010311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But we can relax. With our current pace, there's no way they'll be ahead of us.	
102010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It doesn't matter what Cerberus is up to. We still need to investigate the source of the signal.	
102010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted have been eliminated. Anything to report, Liv?	
102010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No sign of the target "Iron Maiden" or the Construct Tifa near the signal source...	
102010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	A wasted trip, huh...	
102010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wait, is that a...?	
102010406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is it?	
102010407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A discarded Inver-Device.	
102010408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Discarded? Why would a Construct throw away their Inver-Device?	
102020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, what's the infection status of those two Suzaku Squad Constructs?	
102020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	100%. The Punishing Virus is already taking over their bodies. Past the point of no return...	
102020103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So, besides destroying them, there's nothing else that can be done.	
102020104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe... We could try to, um... check—	
102020105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	—Check them for clues about Suzaku or Tifa... It's got to be done.	
102020106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, don't be too hard on yourself.	
102020107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commencing data extraction...

102020109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Commandant! Wake up! Serum... Give Commandant more serum!

102020115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Soldier	1	Tifa! Remember what Commandant just said?!	
102020116	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tifa	1	Commandant asked us... to witness the new dawn of humanity, on his behalf...	
102020117	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tifa	1	So... I've got to... keep living... right? Only then will I... be able to... see the light of dawn...	
102020118	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Leader	1	We've got to go back.	
102020119	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tifa	1	But, Commandant's body!

102020122	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	？？？	1	Get out!

102020124	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	？？？	1	You're right, pretty girl... Only the living will see the dawn...	
102020125	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	？？？	1	And in this world, only the powerful survive.	
102020126	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Leader	1	Who... are you?	
102020127	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Soldier	1	He... stopped the Corrupted with the mere force of his presence...	
102020128	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Leader	1	Is that... the power of the Punishing Virus? How can that be?	
102020129	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	？？？	1	You Constructs are the only ones down here capable of protecting human Commandants.

102020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Suzaku Squad Construct	1	There must... be a way... to bring Tifa back...	
102020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's too dangerous! Pull out!	
102020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No signal?	
102020205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	His Inver-Device is broken... That's why he can't recall his consciousness or hear us.	
102020206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's impossible to defeat so many without an Iso-Device—hope he hangs in there.	
102020207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We could really use another Iso-Device round about now... Tch.

102020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I hate to admit it, but we can only trust what Vera told us.	
102020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Only Iso-Fields can neutralize those Corrupted shields.

102020406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Suzaku Squad Construct	1	Please give me... Tifa's Inver-Device...	
102020407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If we give it to him... he might...

102040404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm the one who got us into this mess...	
102040405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Coughs) It's getting worse... Just put me down...	
102040406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Stuff it already, Lee!	
102040407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wha?!	
102040408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll bring you back, no matter what!	
102040409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv...	
102040410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...Alright, then I'll be counting on you.	
102040411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Corrupted are closing in. We need to hurry.	
103010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Kamui, what's your status?	
103010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Uh, Chrome... I think I'm lost.	
103010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Just as I thought...	
103010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	You're good in a fight, but your sense of direction is appalling...	
103010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Listen up, Kamui, just follow the Navi-Path...	
103010106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Navi? I told you, that thing is useless. It keeps changing directions! It's so annoying...!	
103010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Because it detects threats in real-time and adjusts your route accordingly. The Strike Hawks fight alone, after all.	
103010108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've got my instincts! I don't need a Navi to tell me where the danger is!	
103010109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hang on. There's a Construct up ahead. I'll go ask him the way!	
103010110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	But there are no friendly signals in your vicinity. Hey! Can you still hear me?	
103010111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	You here on a mission too? Well, ain't that a coincidence!	
103010112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	...	
103010113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Yes. Quite.	
103010114	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'm looking for the Estate Museum. On my way to reinforce the Gray Raven. Can you point me in the right direction?	
103010115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	That way.	
103010116	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Oh, it's that way... Guess my Navi was right, after all. Good luck on your mission too, friend!	
103010117	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't mention it.	
103010118	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Well, well. They do have some interesting people on their side, don't they?	
103010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is where the distress signal originated.	
103010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	High Construct casualties, but low levels of Punishing Virus...	
103010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Thankfully, they all recalled their consciousnesses. Their bodies weren't further infected as well.	
103010204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We should do some preliminary recovery, and find out what happened while we're at it.	
103010205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They are covered in gunshot wounds.	
103010206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Whatever did this is packing some serious heat. Be on your guard.	
103010207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Look!	
103010208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Heavy Terrapod	1	Visitor Identification: Thug. Commence program, "Civil Control".	
103010209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's... one of the Estate Terrapods. Someone must have reactivated it.	
103010210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	How many guns did they cram in this thing? Post-Pandemic Age tech really could use some subtlety...	
103010211	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, request backup from nearby team.	
103010212	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay!	
103010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Leave these to me!	
103010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Easy!	
103010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wow, he must be a Tank Construct... That onslaught didn't leave a scratch on him.	
103010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	(Chuckles)	
103010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate structures are falling apart, but their control systems seem pretty much intact.	
103010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate control systems can be accessed via that Terminal. If we can hack the defense codes, we can shut the systems down.	
103010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is that a bionic animal? Cooool!	
103010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wow! It's moving!	
103010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You—	
103010406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He's activated the entire museum security system! And it's at the highest alert! That idiot...	
103020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	These exhibits... look super shady...	
103020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I won't touch them again, I swear!	
103020103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Locked... Tch, of course.	
103020104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Enemies behind us are closing in!	
103020105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No good way around this. Let's deal with them first.	
103020106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	？？？	1	That's far enough. Please leave this place, while you still can.	
103020107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Who... said that?	
103020201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The... the exhibits are being activated!	
103020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Turn on EM Camo, quickly.	
103020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Beamers ahead are hidden behind a force field. Our attacks will bounce right off.	
103020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We'll have to observe their attacks and time our exit carefully. Remember, any hits will disable our EM Camo.	
103020205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door locks disabled. Let's keep going.	
103020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Some sort of barrier is blocking access to the courtyard...	
103020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There's a high Punishing Virus response... behind the force field.	
103020303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It must be some kind of lair.	
103020304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	It is intended to protect you... This is your last chance...	
103020305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	Once you pass through this barrier, there's no turning back.	
103020306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv, insert your Levi-Gun core into the Terminal. It will short the force field.	
103020307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On it.	
103020308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	...	
103020309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The force field has been overloaded. We can continue on our way!	
103020310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go.	
103020401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The fighting there is done. We don't have to rush. Let's clear out the Corrupted nearby first.	
103030101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Phew—mission accomplished.	
103030102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Very thorough. Thank you, Lucia.	
103030201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those Constructs... look a bit abnormal...	
103030202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Their limbs and Inver-Devices are all destroyed, but they've still got vital signs.	
103030203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay...	
103030204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What happened to you? What are you trying to say?	
103030205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay... back...	
103030206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Someone installed Motion Bombs inside them!	
103030207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That's so... messed... up...	
103030208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Disarming these bombs isn't possible right now... We can only give them a bit of distance...	
103030209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	That's what happens when you oppose the Ascendants—I do not wish to see it happen anymore.	
103030210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	But it's too late now. Don't say I didn't warn you.	
103030301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Loyal old Android. He has defended the Estate Museum for a very long time.	
103030302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It would have ended quite differently if he had just succumbed to the power of Ascnet.	
103030303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	But, such is the fate of the weak.	
103030304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Go. Complete your final task.	
103030305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Thank you for releasing me...	
103030306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I... will not allow... them... to defile Mr. Copperfield's legacy...	
103030307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Initiating... central nervous system... self-destruct sequence...	
103030308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Mr. Copperfield... In the end, I failed you. I couldn't protect the Estate...	
103030401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Lucia.	
103030402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What?	
103030403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Now show me what you can do.	
103030404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...	
103030405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I don't mind if the others join in, but in the end... only one of you will remain.	
103030406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	One of... us?	
103030407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Which one will it be?	
103030408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You're weak... just like she said.	
103030409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What... are you saying?	
103030410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey punk—	
103030411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Over here!	
103030412	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What?!	
104010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You found the monitors?	
104010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Yeah... but any equipment exposed to the elements could have been infected.	
104010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hope they still work. Let me try!	
104010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	They seem to be working. It must be my lucky day.	
104010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	We should bring them in for analysis.	
104010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to find somewhere quiet. The battlefield isn't the place for computational work.	
104010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The tremors feel different here. I've got a bad feeling about this.	
104010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll place some EMP bombs in strategic positions.	
104010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Cover me, Lee. Don't hold back.	
104010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You got me...	
104010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Take cover! Baby's gonna blow!	
104010305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Those things don't affect us... What were you thinking?	
104010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The place is strewn with Corrupted parts...	
104010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Status?	
104010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's at 20% power. If we're doing something, now would be the time...	
104010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Emma...	
104020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's very hot here. Commandant... are you okay?	
104020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	In and out. Find a supply point for Commandant.	
104020201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Target sighted! Wow... it looks a lot bigger in real life. What's it called again?	
104020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Vassago, a kind of bionic Sand Worm. It moves through the sand and ambushes its prey.	
104020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Remain vigilant. We don't have much experience in this kind of environment.	
104020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Did you feel that, Lee?	
104020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes. EM Camo. The enemy's using military-grade tech.	
104020303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They could attack from any direction. Watch your back.	
104020304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Identifying target code... BPO-29, status... Deserter?	
104020305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	？？？	1	Lucia? It's you...	
104020306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	？？？	1	Looks like... you aren't with the cleaners.	
104020401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Kamui, don't rush in!	
104020402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Worry not! This is the part I'm actually good at!	
104020403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't like that... I'm getting used to his style somehow...	
104020404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Status update?	
104020405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...And they didn't even clear out the Corrupted here before telling us to set up a supply point?	
104020406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Whatever. More fun for me!	
104030101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This place will be easy to defend.

104030302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Forget about those Corrupted! We've got to get Liv back!

104030402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is it following us? What does it want?	
104030403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	We don't have time to play with you! Lie down like a good boy! HAIYA!!!

104040102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No. I'm sure it'll be fine.	
104040103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Keep your eye on Lucia, Commandant.

104040301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Surrender! I'm not going to kill any Constructs.	
104040302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I refuse!	
104040401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Watanabe can take care of Liv for us.	
104040402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Maybe we should put some distance between us and the enemy, Commandant.	
104040403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...	
104040404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll stop 'em. You get Lee out of here, Commandant!	
105010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We need to move fast. I just hope Kamui's map is accurate...	
105010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Don't make too much noise. We don't want to alert the Forsaken. They're still holding Liv...	
105010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This facility is probably rigged. Stay sharp...

105010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is it?	
105010204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Gone...?	
105010205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Visual system errors? Disorder in the M.I.N.D.?	
105010206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted signals have recovered. We'll have to fight... It won't hurt them, will it?

105010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Follow my mark.	
105010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Graviton detector imaging has commenced. The image is fuzzy, but will suffice.	
105010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But these Corrupted aren't projections.	
105010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	How did the Forsaken get through here with no Graviton Detectors?	
105010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I guess they know this place... Why else would they bring Liv here straight?	
105020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If we want the EMP to affect the maximum number of projectors, we need to find the best spot.	
105020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's Corrupted everywhere. I'll send a signal when the coast is clear.

105020105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay.	
105020201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You said to not let Kamui out of our sights. Is there something?	
105020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, seeing how we're on the dedicated Gray Raven channel...	
105020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I was just checking Kamui's Inver-Device...	
105020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It was running on high-load mode. And there are logs of him trying to turn off his GPS and Comms systems.	
105020205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Turning off his own...	
105020206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He might have his own plans... but I think we definitely need to check in with him more.	
105020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Corrupted are shielding the projectors...	
105020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The one in the middle seems different. I think it must hold the secret to this place.	
105020303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Okay, here goes!	
105020401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commencing capture of next target.	
105020402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Kamui, don't damage its memory shell.	
105020403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Haha, as long as I don't hit him directly, he'll be fine...	
105020404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Done—over to you, Lee.

105030105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami's had enough.	
105030201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This place looks quite oriental. It takes me back...

105030402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	(Deep breaths) Very well...	
105030403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv...	
106010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We're on top of Underground Refugee City 019. During the Post-Pandemic Age it was home to half a million refugees.	
106010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	That's about one-third of Babylonia's current population. Of course, it all ended in tragedy.	
106010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Corpses are piled high at the exits... indicating the severity of the final crisis that erupted inside...

106010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The door's open.

106010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey. Why have we got fewer Corrupted than the Forsaken? You been slacking off or something?

106010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Snap out of it, Nanami. You helping or not?

106020206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	When there's still so many Corrupted... covert action is the only option.

302030604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Must have them all collapse... on the air outlets...

302040301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Too many guards here. No point wasting my energy with them...	
302040302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	We can operate them to battle after transferring their control to my virtual control console...	
302040303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	But I can only build one virtual control console with the materials I have...	
302040304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	One virtual control console can only hijack one guard's control...	
302040305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Which one should we choose?	
302040401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, I see Nanami on the platform far from our right side...	
302040402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She must have dropped into the wrong tunnel and eventually fell there.	
302040403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She's not the type to keep quiet.	
302040404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Watch out, Nithart's guards are coming at us through the other entrance.	
302040405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	She won't let go of us easily. So get ready to fight!	
302040406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, Nanami is fighting alone, please closely monitor her frame's condition...	
302040501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Look what I've got you...	
302040502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Exhibit again that conceit you've shown me before, or my guards will turn you into scrap.	
302040503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Most cunning. Thankfully, I'm her opponent.	
302040504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I have to return to Commandant as quickly as possible.	
302040505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's the last...	
302040506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Destroy her! This is an order from the Queen! Destroy her!	
302040601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The virus has damaged the security process of the energy system. Our hacking is going well so far!	
302040602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Implant the "anti-virus programs"...	
302040603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	If we're able to send these anti-virus programs to the corrupted zone, the infection speed will be greatly slowed down...	
302040604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've already defeated two Corrupted outside...	
302040605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Keep pushing! Don't lose to "yourself," Kamui!	
302040606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The corrupted zone is ahead...	
302040607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This should buy some time for the Gray Raven, right?	
302040701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Unable to open?! What does that mean! I managed to crack into it...	
302040702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That's because your crack is one-way only. You can only open all security doors if you execute the crack.	
302040703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But in that case, the guards can also get in and surround us.	
302040704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So, apart from an "open door"" function, we need a ""close door" one as well. The two actions must be done at the same time.	
302040705	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Easy-peasy! I can connect the two cracking devices to the same "repeater". Problem solved.	
302040706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, repeating is the easy part. The difficult part is that the second cracking device has to connect the "closing" system.	
302040707	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As door opening and door closing are two separate systems, we can only crack it one by one.	
302040708	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Lucia and the others are defending against the guards outside. We have to crack the door closing system quickly.	
302040709	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You need to be quick. As more and more guards are trying to break through the exterior wall, they will break through our defense soon...	
302040710	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Right... But why did the crack fail? Definitely nothing to do with my devices.	
302040711	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes, Nithart crashed the system on purpose while we were cracking. That's why it failed.	
302040712	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll connect the door closing system to my virtual console. If she does that again, she'll be redirected to it.	
302040713	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Operating the final crack... Security doors opened...	
302040714	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Everyone, through the security door! Quick!	
302040715	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee...	
302040716	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay. Operating the final crack... Security doors closed...	
302040801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch your front and back, the guards are tightening the encirclement...	
302040802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We have to destroy them all to prevent them from attacking the rescue aircraft.	
302040803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The royal guards are very difficult to handle. If we don't want to be attacked from both sides, we'd better concentrate our firepower on one side first.	
302040804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Commandant, quick! Which side! I'm gonna blow them all to smithereens!	
302040901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Nithart... she turned off the external sensorium of her frame.	
302040902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She and the royal guards have already fused into one. Even if we concentrate our firepower on her, we'll still be unable to interrupt the guards' attack.	
302040903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Just blow 'em all up!	
302040904	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Can we attack now? Nanami wants to fight!	
302040905	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The Golden Vortex will turn into an inferno soon. We'd better go now. We can't let Nithart be on our way...	
302040906	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, let's make a clean break with Nithart.	
313010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's about time.

313010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We can't keep Commandant and Liv waiting.

313010305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Phew... Okay, that should be enough.

313010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Then I should cut more trees quietly without being noticed by them!	
313010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Yeah! Go!	
313010406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Hm, it looks good, and is far from the Corrupted.

313010703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Lucia came up with the plan anyway, so she should be the one who has to take care of the consequences.	
313010704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	I'll ring the bell before those boomboxes arrive.

313010706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Well, I don't care. At least the firework can start on time.	
313010901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The Gray Raven folks are so cold. They're all celebrating Christmas together without inviting me!

313020304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems that the connection between Commandant and here is over. We'll search this area shortly.	
313020305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll give it my all, Commandant!

313020851	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Wrong. That's a pity. Your Constructs will get hurt if you don't pay more attention.	
313020852	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	First Question. Which one is Kamui?	
313020853	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Correct, though it's merely a simple one.	
313020854	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Second question. Which one is Liv?	
313020855	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Correct. As expected, that humility has made it too obvious.	
313020856	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Third question. Which one is Bianca?	
313020857	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	How does it feel like to be mistaken for Watanabe, your sworn enemy?	
313020858	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	—!	
313020859	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No need to overreact. I've been watching it from the very beginning.	
313020860	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fourth question. Which one is Ayla?	
313020861	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No fun. When she said association, the answer nearly came to the surface.	
313020862	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fifth question. Which one is Chrome?	
313020863	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	That said, Chrome appearing in this place really surprised me. I thought he was preparing for the next special mission.	
313020864	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Sixth Question. Which one is Lee?	
313020865	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Well, as you've excluded all deceptive answers, it's no surprise that you chose the correct one.	
313020866	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Why don't you give scythes a shot? You seem to be a great scythe wielder.	
313020867	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	After all, nothing is hard for you... Hah.	
313020868	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Seventh question. Which one is Karenina... To be honest, I don't want to go on like this either. The rest are all super simple ones.	
313020869	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Uh... Alright alright. Correct. All words coming from this mouth would be censored by the connection system.	
313020870	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	The last question. Which one is Lucia? Press the confirm button <color=#ff6633>now</color> to finish this game.	
313020871	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Why don't you act? Lucia stood right there. You didn't fall asleep, did you?	
313020872	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	...What!?	
313020873	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	That's not Lucia... Hahahaha, so you really can recognize her. Hahaha!	
313020874	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Perfect. You're right...	
313020875	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	—!!	
313020876	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	...For hell's sake. I knew it. The bond between commandant and Construct is but a joke.	
313020877	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	How can you not recognize the Construct staying by your side all the time?	
313020878	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	No way. How can you pick this one? You're not a moron, aren't you?	
313020879	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Fine...	
313020880	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Vera	1	Lu... Musashi, catch that Nozzle!	
313020881	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	？？？	1	Here, Commandant!	
313030101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Hey, Akdilek girl, what are you doing...?	
313030102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Sorry, my hand slipped.	
313030103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Causing troubles instead of killing me, huh... Lucky that you're a Support type.	
313030104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Sophia doesn't understand what you are talking about.	
313030105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Whatever... Keep pretending.	
313030106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	But you can't keep hiding. We have big guys coming.	
313030107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	As expected, they are Attacker Constructs. Very old models though.	
313030108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	What exactly are you planning?	
313030301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Can I use these leaves?	
313030302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Yeah, they still have a bitter taste, but I guess we don't have a better option.	
313030303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	We need more though. These aren't enough.	
313030304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Corrupted spotted. Let's get rid of them first.	
313030351	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I never knew there were plants in the desert.	3
313030352	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	I feel sorry for these plants...	3
313030353	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	I bet these leaves have never thought they would get picked in a desert.	3
313030354	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I wonder what kind of zongzi Lucia would like?	3
313030355	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I think red bean will be a great addition to the zongzi.	3
313030356	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	The leaves are a bit annoying, but zongzi contain meat and rice, making them a great food.	3
313030501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	This Corrupted... I knew it...	
313030502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Focus on the Corrupted around you. You could easily die if you get distracted.	
313030503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Yes! Got it.

313040304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	So this is like a mind training, where Liv must answer Commandant's questions. I will do my best!

313040311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	An animal as boyfriend...?	
313040312	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	No way.	
313040313	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System Voice	1	Too bad! You failed to answer within the time limit! You must face a forfeit!	
313040314	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	The ammo of my Levi-Gun has all become water... Is it because we are in a game?	
313040315	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	It's a game from the Golden Age. The questions are probably based on the pop culture of that era.	
313040316	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	I see. I need a better understanding of the Golden Age culture to answer these questions.	
313040317	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Let me connect to the old human database... Alright. Liv will be able to answer any question now!	
313040318	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	？？？	1	Here comes the first question—

313040320	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	What?! How can there be such a question? How did it know...

313040322	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Argh... I-I once took away the snacks that Commandant hid in the room!	
313040323	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	？？？	1	The second question is—

313040325	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	...There are many of them. I can't really tell them all...	
313040326	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	？？？	1	Hmm... Let's skip this question then.

313040328	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Liv	1	Absolutely...not...	
313040329	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Liv, are you alright? Your face looks really red.

313040451	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	Watermelon	1	The watermelon has a metallic shine. This must be the "mission item" that Liv mentioned.	3

313040504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Nanami only put us in the game. I didn't control their actions.	
313040505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Lee	1	Perhaps there's something in the watermelon. Let's stop them first.

110355	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I locked up all those Corrupted that the Estate could not destroy inside this room.	
110356	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	If those people are going to use you, I would rather you get consumed by the Corrupted...	
110357	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Did he purposely separate us?	
110358	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What a waste of effort. I've already found you.	
110359	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That voice sounds so familiar...	
110360	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey, butler. Did something happen over there?	
110361	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He's not answering. Let's find a way out first.	
110362	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will stop you right here.	
110363	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I must protect... Mr. Copperfield's... lifelong work...	
110364	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	...	
110365	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Thanks for all the joy you brought me today, Mr. Butler.	
110366	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I'm very sorry... But I must let Punishing Virus infect you.	
110367	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It's all for Miss Luna.	
110368	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will... never yield!	
110369	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Ugh... Aaargh!	
110370	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110371	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110372	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
110374	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110375	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110376	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
110401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Corrupted incoming... Emma... lost... Must... protect... Emma...	
110402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Go away...	
110403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Must... find... Emma...	
110404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Go away!	
110405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I need to scan Zack's memory shell before attempting to repair him.	
110406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The structure of the memory shell is simple, but for some reason, it isn't deeply infected.	
110407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's investigate together.	
110408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The tag of the important record is "Operation Grand Retreat".	
110409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing Virus has infested these data zones. The virus illusions are impacting our data query.	
110410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I've made some progress. All related data found. Loading now.	
110411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I just need to repair one more section to start reading Zack's memories.	
110412	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Clues of... Emma's lost items...	
110413	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Find Emma... Items...	
110414	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Find Emma... Items...	
110415	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Calculating... Completed... West halls...	
110416	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Large-scale data corruption here. Leave it to me.	
110417	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	At the end of the Post-Pandemic Age, Corrupted controlled by the Punishing Virus already had military production capabilities.	
110418	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Even with the comprehensive defense of this Estate Museum, it could not hold against the overwhelming number of Corrupted.	
110419	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That was the situation they had to face.	
110420	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Zack... help... Emma and Copperfield... retreat...	
110421	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We've reached the deepest part of the data. The record shows Zack was already being infected at that time.	
110422	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But somehow the infection was restricted and controlled at a certain level.	
110423	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's clear the virus illusions here and read the final record.	
110424	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Zack... We are the only ones left here.	
110425	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will take you to the Static Lock. I hope Mr. Copperfield's research will work.	
110426	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Before that, I just need to calm you down... I never thought we would end up like this.	
110601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recreating memory now. Hope we can find clues of the Ascendant.	
110602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Corrupted	1	—! —!	
110603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Punishing Virus injection complete... All weapon system activated... Increasing power output...	
110604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait, why is she using the power of Punishing Virus, but still seen as an enemy by Corrupted?	
110605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I haven't fought for a long time. Looks like... this will be my last fight.	
110606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Gargh. This power still impacts my mind... In the end, it still tests my faith...	
110607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk. I thought that God bloke abandoned me long ago...	
110608	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are way too many Corrupted. Commandant, we should retreat now!	
110609	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I should continue... with my final cleansing...	
110610	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Simulation in progress. Commandant, please watch closely!	
110611	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Even in this time, her frame capabilities are as good as ours in battle.	
110612	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But we have no information at all... I wonder how many secrets did the Church have in the past?	
110613	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All those Corrupted came from the machine factory's direction.	
110614	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If the source remains, their numbers would only keep growing... Exactly like what happened to us.	
110615	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Sister's destination... seems to be right there.	
110616	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Phew, just like those little brats... You always look down on adults.	
110617	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Do you know how difficult it is to be an adult...? Get out of my way!	
110618	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	...	
110619	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk.	
110620	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Punishing Virus' impact must have peaked around this point.	
110621	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These are... the large firefighting robots we met before...	
110622	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yet, Punishing Virus modified them into arsonists. How ironic.	
110623	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Data interfered by virus illusions...	
110624	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. I'm activating emergency mode.	
110625	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay. We've seen it many times. We know what to do.	
110626	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Virus interference removed. Re-syncing now.	
110627	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, the virus infection is rooted deeply here... It needs a deep cleaning. I'll need help.	
110628	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	She managed to... hold off so many Corrupted here...	
110629	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As if she had an endless reserve of energy... Was it because of the Punishing Virus, or her own obsession?	
110630	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, it's a new combat objective!	
110631	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of broken memory probably came from when Sister was hunted by Nozzle.	
110632	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to manually repair the noise while tracing the memory.	
110633	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recording complete. So this is when Sister met Nozzle.	
110634	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Next section... Okay, done.	
110635	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	After ascension, even Nozzle could use tactics against its enemy.	
110636	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The final section is also recorded.	
110637	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There were just too many Corrupted. Even Sister had no choice but to run.	
110638	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	This is the factory's core...	
110639	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Why would humans design such a fragile structure... Once it's destroyed, everything will be lost. How unreliable.	
110640	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data shows that Sister had already reached her infection limit.	
110641	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But she hadn't completed her objective yet...	
110642	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's finish this journey with her.	
110643	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All missions in the current stage have been completed. Go to the memory breakpoint to start the next stage.	3
110644	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of memory is already close to the end.	
110645	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...This should be Sister's final struggle.	
110646	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's go get her final memory.	
110647	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110648	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110649	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
117010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data videos show that Rohacchi found some spark falling into the ruins.	
117010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And it became very interested in it.	
117010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It then traced all the way toward the spark's landing point.	
117010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It seemed to have also activated some mechanism within the ruins...	
117010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To further analyze the videos in this memory data...	
117010106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I will recreate the situation by video.	
117010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory is completely restored. Rohacchi opened this switch to move to a higher level.	3
117010108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The sealed road opened again.	3
117010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On Rohacchi's journey, it bumped into the source of the spark and noises... It was attacked by "Roseblade".	
117010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As expected, all the suddenly appeared Constructs were related to Ascendants. They were also after "Tenebrion".	
117010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I suggest we carefully study the combat data against "Roseblade". It will benefit our subsequent operations.	
117010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Rohacchi seemed to have met similar-looking machines.	
117010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It thought they were its own kind and went up to them.	
117010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Only to be met with sudden assault.	
117010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Subsequent memory data has been deciphered. Transforming to digital video now.	
117010305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	In the memory, IX-68 squatted next to one of its "kin," slowly patting its body...	
117010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Here, Rohacchi met Nanami...	
117010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And suddenly attacked...!?	
117010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Perhaps we could find more information about Nanami from this memory.	
117010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The battle didn't last long, and Nanami seemed to have moved together with Rohacchi for some time.	
117010501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the memory, Rohacchi and Nanami defeated many Corrupted and returned to the upper level of the ruins.	
117010502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Looks like the "mural" they were talking about must be nearby.	
117010503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll continue with my analysis, Commandant. Please look out for any info related to the "mural" that caused them to awaken.	
117010601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to Rohacchi's memory, this should be where they first saw the mural.	
117010602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But when it took Nanami there, they found nothing.	
117010603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Apart from those machines wandering nearby.	
117010604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe the ruins collapsed because of us, so the murals also fell to another location.	
117010605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No matter what, this piece of memory is worth studying again.	
118010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I found well-preserved facilities underneath the ruins.	
118010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I tried my best to stay awake.	
118010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I knew I didn't have much time left.	
118010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	So I had to break away from the Corrupted ASAP.	
118010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	One after another. Aren't you all tired??	
118010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why don't you just come all together? At least it can save some time.	
118010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I must keep moving. No one can stop me.	
118010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	At the bottom of the ruins, I found a long and narrow corridor. Unlike the upper levels, the facilities there were kept very well.	
118010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I was exhausted from non-stop fighting.	
118010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Those Corrupted seemed to have noticed this too, and launched an assault together.	
118010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Tsk, the number just keeps growing...	
118010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Looks like you need my help.	
118010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I know what you're planning. I'm not done yet!	
118010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Hah, you bluff. I know full well about your body.	
118010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...I will never let the virus infect me.

311010204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So the defense mechanism's stopped working. Aren't the humans here going to do something about it?	
311010205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we've done it! All defense machines are back in order.	
311010206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Remember, the defense machines are armed with powerful weapons, but they have poor armor.

309010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is this place, Diana...?	
309010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	During the early outbreak of the Punishing Virus, Murmansk was once very prosperous due to its geographical advantages.	
309010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It absorbed many inland cities and formed a commonwealth. This place was part of the northeast commonwealth.	
309010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	And one of the birthplaces of Forest Guard.

309010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The target is not far ahead, but why didn't you ask the Forest Guard to follow up?	
309010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	You said Evan was on his feet. There's no way he could lose the Corrupted.	
309010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	But we didn't see him when we locked on to the target...

309010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Search everywhere! Everywhere!	
309010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Someone found a 5cm long, shattered titanium plate...

309010306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...Yes! There's human sebum and hair on the edges.

309010309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee, are you talking about the wandering Corrupted in the forest?	
309010310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Not just the forest. They could also be among the snowy rocks, even river beds.

309010314	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The two samples matched perfectly! Evan was here! Now I can make a pheromone detector.	
309010315	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Is that...?	
309010316	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as Evan is still breathing, we can detect the pheromone he produces.	
309010317	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Found him!!	
309010318	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	He's trapped on the shell of the Corrupted. Why...? Are they using him to protect themselves?	
309010319	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Adjust your equipment immediately! Only melee weapons are allowed. We must not hurt humans!	
309010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I can't cut through these metal bones without hurting the rescue target.	
309010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our only option is to make a strategic relocation. Take it back to the Forest Guard stronghold first, then we can think of another way.	
309010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee... How's his health doing?	
309010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't worry, he's not infected. Just a little hypothermia.

309010505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. Mr. Lee didn't include Evan in his calculation...	
309010506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Some of those legs are very close to Evan's location.	
309010507	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please, everyone, don't hurt Evan.	
10099001	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That cross-shaped terminal is causing EM polarization on the other devices.	4
10099002	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The affected devices are nigh-immune to most of our attacks.	4
10099003	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Attack the cross-shaped terminal continuously to remove this status from them.	6
10099004	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The light beams radiating from the Heteromer Terminal will repair the Heteromer devices.	5
10099005	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But be careful, these beams contain viruses that will cause stress to our sensory systems if we get hit directly.	6
10099006	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Commandant of Gray Raven, these oddly shaped terminals have the ability to split apart.	5
10099007	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The polar electric current circulating between them can paralyze a Construct's sensory and reduce its mobility.	5
10099008	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But consecutive attacks can reverse their polarity.	4
10099009	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Consider this option if they appear in this form.	4
10090101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the map, we've managed to land at the designated location—	
10090102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The data analysis cabin on the space station.	
10090103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But... nothing's left of our aircraft...	
10090104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If we can destroy the space station's defense system, then we should be able to retreat when the main forces arrive.	
10090105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	These terminals give me the creeps...	
10090106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Is this what the report was talking about? The strange corruption phenomenon localized only in this space station?	
10090107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Be careful, Lee.	
10090108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is...!	
10090109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We managed to unlock a higher clearance level...	
10090110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait, that cross just now is guarding the exit now...	
10090111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to my preliminary scanning results, this type of enemy is not made of any known conventional machinery...	
10090112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It is... composed entirely of the Punishing Virus...	
10090113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This space station really IS hiding some important secrets...	
10090114	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like we can't just simply blow this place up.	
10090115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guys, I've turned off the space station's sensor systems.	
10090116	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090117	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This should help relieve some pressure for Babylonia.	
10090118	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, our first step to victory.	
10090201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We have arrived at the second target location.	
10090202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the analysis, this should be the weapons control backend...	
10090203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...after being corrupted and modified by the virus.	
10090204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A lot of inactive Heteromers in here...	
10090205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If they all turn hostile like what happened just now...	
10090206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Do you see that cross-shaped enemy in the middle?	
10090207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're unsure how it manages to...	
10090208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...But it seems like this type of enemy can create enemies, and not to mention that it—	
10090209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Holds the key to solving our problems, I know...	
10090210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those black pillars... decompose... and reconstruct...	
10090211	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Every bit of Hetero-matter of the Punishing Virus in this space station could become our enemy...	
10090212	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our attacks can deactivate them, at least temporarily.	
10090213	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as it works, right?	
10090214	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, let's deal with them like this for now.	
10090215	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Finally...	
10090216	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah... Some Hetero-matter have regenerated and are moving again!	
10090217	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tch, we're not really in a position to play attrition warfare here...	
10090218	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, access the control system directly. Lee—	
10090219	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Got it.	
10090220	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Done!	
10090221	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All close-range defense systems for interception purposes are offline!	
10090222	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090223	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The subsequent forces have begun issuing boarding signals.	
10090224	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We won't have to fight on our own anymore.	
10090301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But, you do look like you're in some sort of trouble.	
10090302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's skip the small talk.	
10090303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Consider this my little present.	
10090304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies just now displayed a completely different mode of attack.	
10090305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But Watanabe's already figured out how to deal with them...	
10090306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Such strength...	
10090307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He feels like a different person.	
10090308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	So, is everything fine?	
10090309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...	
10090310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Oh, it's all thanks to you, Mr. Watanabe.	
10090311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Hah, spunky as ever.	
10090401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	...This place looks different from the others.	
10090402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The door is encrypted. Your specialty, Lee.	
10090403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Analyzing...)	
10090404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I... see...	
10090405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's four corrupted terminals in the four corners of this compartment.	
10090406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Varied combinations can be produced by activating them...	
10090407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Let's try different combinations.	
10090408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door's cracked, but the Heteromers have entered defense mode...	
10090409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Well, progress. At least.	
10090410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's finish off the remaining enemies.	
10090411	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Levels, huh? The mysterious blocks on the terminal might be the key.	3
10090412	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It appears that interacting with the terminal can change the shape of the block...	3
10090413	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Looks like we have to choose a shape...	3
10090414	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Maybe something will happen if we leave a certain number of blocks in the corresponding shapes.	3
10090501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Lucia... She's all pumped up all of a sudden...	
10090502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I see. It's a challenge, isn't it? Hah...	
10090503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	All right, I'll accept it—Let's see who can sweep the enemies faster.	
10090504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	How's that? Still got it in me, eh?	
10090505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Impressive.	
10090506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's work together to protect Liv from the last wave of attacks.	
10090507	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	On it.	
10090508	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Is this what I'm looking for...?	
10090509	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What did you say, Watanabe?	
10090510	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nothing.	
10090601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	You... did not comply with... the regulations...	
10090602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Now... Children... Please kindly follow Korolev to the confinement cabin...	
10090603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Accept your punishment...	
10090604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	If any resistance occurs... Korolev will follow the rules... to adopt the minimum enforcement measures...	
10090605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, that... is...?	
10090606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not composed of Hetero-matter. It's a real Corrupted... I'm afraid...	
10090607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's that Kamui incarnate that's been broadcasting the whole time?	
10090608	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But, in such a high viral density environment... Can a machine truly maintain its original mind?	
10090609	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It feels like... it's being held in captivity alone in here... What could be the reason for that...?	
10090610	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We might never find the answers... All I know now is that we only have one option...	
10090611	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Confinement...	
10090701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Gravity is starting to act up around here...	
10090702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The core of the space station... The gravity room. We finally made it.	
10090703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	It's the gravity experiment here that gave birth to Hetero-matter—	
10090704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Who would have thought—Humans aren't just suffering from the Punishing Virus, they even gave it new life...	
10090705	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watanabe... Thank you for fighting with us all this way...	
10090706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Don't worry, I won't leave until the threat of this space station is resolved.	
10090707	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I know those enemies were just warm-up for you.	
10090708	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Now, let's show them what we can do.	
10090709	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those crosses... again...	
10090710	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's like their presence is conveying a certain message...	
10090711	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we can't go any further...	
10090712	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is an artificially designed area. Now that we've dispatched the enemies—	
10090713	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The mechanism should be returning to normal.	
10090714	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Try to get closer to the edge.	
10090715	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What a stunning design...	
10090716	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This can only be achieved by precise gravity manipulation...	
10090717	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	If I recall, there's gravity generators inside Babylonia as well, no?	
10090718	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yes... But I never thought I would come so close to its prototype...	
10090719	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've just tested its integrity. It should be good to go—	
10090720	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's advance!	
10090721	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is...	
10090722	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Some kind of mechanism again... Guess we can't skip past it.	
10090723	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Ah, it's a device used to lock those rings.	
10090724	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looks like it's used to stabilize the rings and gravity core.	
10090725	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those rings should function in a similar way. Let's go.	
10090726	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yeah...	
10090801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I'm not sure what would happen if you mess up...	
10090802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	But please follow my instructions.	
10090803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The first message is—	
10090804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	From two to one.	
10090805	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Do you have any ideas?	
10090806	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems to be related to these light beams...	
10090807	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll try to brute-force it, but it's going to take some time.	
10090808	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	And it might trigger high alert. Anyway, let's get through this together, Commandant.	
10090809	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It worked.	
10090810	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Miss Ayla, please provide the next instruction!	
10090811	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, the next message is—	
10090812	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	From abstract to concrete.	
10090813	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Abstract and concrete... We've encountered enemies like that before.	
10090814	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Which means... "Starting from the abstract"?	
10090815	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's do it then!	
10090816	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We can move on now!	
10090817	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The path is blocked off again.	
10090818	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	As you can see... There's three movable mechanisms...	
10090819	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We do!	
10090820	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	According to the record, the tip here is—	
10090821	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The beginning is the end.	
10090822	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hmm, I think I kind of get it...	
10090823	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Same as before, I'll try to crack it forcibly.	
10090824	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As expected, you solved the puzzle first, Commandant.	
10090825	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, here we're again...	
10090826	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	It should be the last mechanism for this ring.	
10090827	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Please tell us the last tip.	
10090828	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, listen carefully—	
10090829	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Disarray is unity.	
10090830	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is even more cryptic...	
10090831	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But experience tells us that we have to create a certain pattern using these light beams.	
10090832	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Although I'm not quite certain about it, I think we might want to create as many divisions and chaos as we can with the beams.	
10090833	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Backend hacking is also in progress.	
10090834	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I think... We got it?	
10090835	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yep, well done!	
10090836	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...	
10090837	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The control mechanism for the next ring has appeared.	
10090838	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's continue.	
10090839	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Only a few rings left.	
10090840	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yeah, we'd better hurry. Other troops should be on their way now.	
10090841	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No matter what enemy awaits...	
10090842	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This time, we have countless teammates on our side.	
10090843	0	Guide/Guide2	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hmm... maybe it's implying that we have to create a certain pattern.	3
10090844	0	Guide/Guide3	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Two into... Maybe it's something about the number of light beams.	3
10090845	0	Guide/Guide4	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	One might mean a circle, but what does it have to do with the tip?	3
10090846	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Two paths, a single line. I feel like we're nearing the answer.	3
10090847	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Is it meant to be taken literally...?	3
10090848	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If the lines that are crossed becomes connected instead... I guess?	3
10090849	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	A ring structure...? Could it be a clue to solving this puzzle?	3
10090850	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Having the beams circulate should match the tip...	3
10090851	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Connecting it in another way might be worth a try...	3
10090852	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Maybe we should make the straight lines at the beginning into something else?	3
10090853	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Light beams... Prism... Three points... Perhaps we can indeed change something...	3
10090854	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Make the single... No, the two merged light beams split. Perhaps... Maybe...	3
10090855	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I will hack into it from the backend now.	3
10090901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies here look different...	
10090902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They didn't decomposed upon being defeated. Instead—	
10090903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They entered into a state similar to hibernation... Their energy flow is stable inside their remains...	
10090904	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No more paths forming ahead. Might be because of these enemies.	
10090905	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I don't know what you make of it, but we'd better act with caution.	
10090906	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After all, this is a new variant from the ones we've been dealing with.	
10090907	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait... Are they... gathering around us?	
10090908	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They aren't displaying aggression somehow...	
10090909	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nonsense.	
10090910	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Unless...	
10090911	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What's on your mind, Watanabe?	
10090912	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	...	
10090913	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll speak for him—Unless the virus chooses to.	
10090914	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The virus chooses to? You mean the Punishing Virus is able to make a choice?	
10090915	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's a sign of intelligence, but...	
10090916	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I don't know... I'm afraid no one knows why, frankly.	
10090917	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Well... It's not like we have many options now.	
10090918	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A path is made... The energy inside these enemies are transferred to the mechanism...	
10090919	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And also flowing towards the gravity core.	
10090920	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Sounds just like a recipe for disaster.	
10090921	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That core is the primary target of this operation.	
10090922	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At the very least... We're getting closer to our final target.	
10090923	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No more new enemies, Lucia.	
10090924	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Then, this should be the final mechanism.	
10090925	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After passing through here, we'll be facing the largest Heteromer that is mooching off on the gravity core.	
10090926	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hesitation will only lead to our defeat at this point.	
10090927	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Gray Raven, prepare for battle!	
30150101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Mr. Lee truly never misses a shot!	
30150102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I won't waste a single bullet.	
30150103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Mission complete. Prepare to retreat. Commandant should be waiting for us outside here.	
30150104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Mr. Lee, it seems we've been going round in circles...	
30150105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...	
30150106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This way.	
30150107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	Hey, I heard Mr. Lee has no sense of direction. It isn't true, is it? (Softly)	
30150108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Remaining Heteromers discovered ahead. Everyone, ready to engage.	
30150109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Constructs	1	Roger!	
30150110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, we've arrived at the designated location. Nearby devices show apparent traces of being tampered by Gabriel.	
30150111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	All devices are expected to be recovered in five minutes.	
30150112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After this, Engineering Force can "touch down" on the space station and carry out their duties...	
30150113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Mr. Lee! Nearby devices have returned to operation all of a sudden!	
30150114	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tsk, what a tedious parting gift.	
309030701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Squeak—! Rat's got some goodies for you! A new life for you!	
309030702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Squeak—! Rat's got some goodies for you—! A new life for you—!	
309030703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Wait a sec! Why are they beating up my bro?	
309030704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rat	1	Whatever...! The goodies are delivered, squeak—!	
11100101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! The Corrupted are swarming in—	
11100102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'm here to help. Please continue the rescue and evacuation.	
11100103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll do my best!	
11100104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'll handle the Corrupted on the other side with Lee.	
11100105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Understood.	
11100106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All people have been evacuated, and some of the wounded have received emergency treatment.	
11100107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Thank you...	
11100201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Be careful. Those two Corrupted's energy reactions are abnormal.	
11100202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Stay alert. They might be hiding nearby.	
11100203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll take care of them. You take the opportunity to break through the passage.	
11100204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Okay, then we'll destroy the Corrupted lurking there.	
11100205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia.	
11100206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Got it...	
11100207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	The battle is over.	
11100208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The passage is clear!	
11100209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's clear, Sophia!	
11100210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Understood. I'm coming now.	
11100301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia!	
11100302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	
11100303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Watch out for their special attacks.	
11100304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	It's all cleared.	
11100305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Let's meet up with them now. Changyu's there too.	
11100401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's shell is hard to break. Liv, can you identify its weaknesses?	
11100402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm trying!	
11100403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We can't go on like this.	
11100404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Gray Raven is fighting the Core's Heteromers.	
11100405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Fend off the Corrupted. Ensure they won't bring any trouble to us.	
11100406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...I'll take care of the ones behind us.	
11100407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	If you push yourself too far, I'll stop you no matter what.	
11100408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Don't sweat it. I have a plan.	
11100409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	All cleared. Changyu, what's the situation on your end?	
11100410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...	
11100411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Changyu?	
11100501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Sorry... I've dragged you down...	
11100502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Then save your breath. I have to deal with your wounds first.	
11100503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	...Roger that.	
11100504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	This way leads back to the carriage.

11100506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll be back right away.	
11100601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll help you collect the parts.	
11100602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please be careful, Sophia...	
11100603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll be careful...	
11100604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's enough.	
11100605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Half of the Corrupted have been destroyed. This area is safe for now.	
10100101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! It's...	
10100102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A hideous appearance indeed.	
10100103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Can you hear me, Gray Ravens? I've detected that you've successfully landed on the train.	
10100104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...And we are now facing the target.	
10100105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee, what do you mean?	
10100106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Hetero-Core has been highly corrupted and mutated when falling to Earth. The target we've been after is right before us.	
10100107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Permission for engagement, Commandant.	
10100108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Heterozygote's claws seem super dangerous.	
10100109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Perhaps we can entice it to attack us, then we have a chance to destroy its claws.	
10100110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not working. Our attacks hardly deal any damage to it.	
10100111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch out, it isn't finished yet.	
10100201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This train is...?

10100203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing concentration continues to surge... It's corrupting the new train!	
10100204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, bring sufficient serum. We'll go after it.	
10100205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	Hey, you're not here to make the deal, are you?	
10100206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	What are you talking about?	
10100207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Changyu	1	If it stops here, Lord Jamilah's plan will be disrupted. It's time to act, Sophia!	
10100208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	...Understood. Then push it to the front.	
10100209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Who are these...?	
10100210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The sandstorm has disrupted our visual system and the number of Corrupted is increasing. They will hinder our pursuit.	
10100211	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, I propose that we adjust the operation, passing through inside the train to intercept our target.	
10100212	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Glass cupola...	
10100213	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Perhaps we can go inside the train through the cupola.	
10100214	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At this rate, the train will enter the area ravaged by sandstorm... We'll be forced to abandon the pursuit.	
10100215	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But if we don't deal with it right now, this train will be the next victim...	
10100301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those mechanoids are... attacking each other?	
10100302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	
10100303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...It seems that the uncorrupted mechanoids are defending against the corrupted ones.	
10100304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll help.	
10100305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You're here too, Sophia.	
10100306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	In order to evacuate the people, we have to intercept the Heterozygote formed by core mutation.	
10100307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This way!	
10100308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	That is the aristocrats' carriage. If we enter without permission...	
10100309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	Commoners and aristocrats, aren't we humans at the end of the day? Come this way if you want to live!	
10100310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	...	
10100311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Commoner	1	Okay, I got it!	
10100312	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We're safe now.	
10100313	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That's great...	
10100314	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We'd better leave once we've planned our next step.	
10100315	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	(Akdilek Record)	
10100316	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	This train is refitted with the Central Purification Filter designs of the City Series of 020, 030, and 050.	
10100317	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	But the truth is, the filter is not capable of supporting the whole train.	
10100318	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Therefore, after the completion of all works, all carriages will be classified and, superior races will be separated from the inferior ones.	
10100319	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	System	1	Like Babylonia, we will keep hope alive.	
10100401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Sophia, enemy signals come from there!	
10100402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	There's a ladder ahead on the train roof.	
10100403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If we'd been allowed to do our work earlier, none of this would've happened.	
10100404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Message from the command center... Reinforcements?	
10100405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Move now, Commandant.	
10100406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wait, something falling down!	
10100407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	No more obstacles. I have to reach Changyu quickly.	
10100408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go, Commandant!	
10100409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Is it... a letter?	
10100410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	My name... It no longer matters. I thought I could have gotten through this train and completed the mission.	
10100411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	But in the end, I was still a fool. I was classified as a pariah, a slave.	
10100412	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	If we don't act... The Ascendants will...	
10100413	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	I'm already drained... So...!	
10100414	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Please be careful of... a thing called "Lullaby".	
10100501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The kid from Akdilek... seems to be severely wounded.	
10100502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Bring it on!	
10100503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We're able to close in on the enemies at this rate.	
10100504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait, Lucia, Lee. The Heterozygote's reaction...

10100508	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, Lucia and Lee have fallen off the train!	
10100509	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	—!!	
10100510	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If we get off the train now, those people might...	
10100511	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The radar doesn't lose Lucia and Lee's signals...	
10100512	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	—!!	
10100513	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	At this rate... Let's go back to the carriage first and wait for Lucia and Lee, Commandant.	
10100601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Corrupted	1	Urgh—!

10100604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Hope I can still handle it.	
10100605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	The gate operating system has been damaged a bit.	
10100606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	We can find the parts from the nearby remains to repair it...	
10100607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Only uncorrupted parts can be used to fix the gate.	
10100608	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	There are many Corrupted nearby. Any mistakes will alert them. Be careful.	
10100609	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	...Still works.	
10100610	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Everything seems to have remained the same.	
10100611	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Then, I only have to wait on the second floor.	
10100612	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Finally, the upper floor... Should be able to see the train soon.	
10100613	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	We need to move fast.	
10100614	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	It's Gronin Station notice...	
10100615	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	...This station will cease operations once the construction of Gestalt's new circuit network is completed.	
10100616	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	All gates will be closed from today onwards, and the staff will be transported out of this place once their IDs are deleted.	
10100617	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	But those track maintenance machines, whether they are personal property or not, are not allowed to be taken away from this station.	
10100618	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Afterward, (an unclear name) will take over the station.

10100621	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	But the gate has blocked the passage. We have to close it again as soon as possible.	
10100701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	There are many Corrupted lurking around.	
10100702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	We can't go forward if we don't deal with this.	
10100801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	All cleared. And the next is...	
10100802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Bianca... Why are you here?	
10100803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Lucia? and that motorcycle...	
10100804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I found it ahead. I'm ready to go after it now.

10100807	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	What's wrong?	
10100808	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You're not going?	
10100809	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	(Sighs)	
10100901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Full speed ahead!	
10100902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Wait, slow down!	
10100903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The train runs too fast, but I can't lag behind anymore. Commandant needs me.	
10100904	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	——	
10100905	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Bianca, please shoot down the enemies in our way, otherwise we won't be able to approach the train.	
10100906	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Bianca	1	Target confirmed in the Hawkeye sight distance.	
10100907	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That's good enough, Bianca. Let's jump on the train!	
10101001	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Rail Heterozygote	1	—!	
10101002	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's still moving forward. The train will stop running if the engine is corrupted, and the people will...	
10101003	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The filter will go down if the train stops...	
10101004	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Which means arriving at the terminal earlier than expected?	
10101005	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Sophia	1	This isn't the train's terminal... Our train won't stop there!

10101007	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's just like in the space station. A faint energy activity still remains within that burnt frame!	
10101008	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Same move again? But this time...

10121019	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BulijiteNormal01.png	Bridget	1	But don't push yourselves too hard.

10121102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I did.	
10121103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	...But not enough, Lucia!	
10121104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	My shots aren't connecting with her... Wait, could she be?!

10121106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	You take on my face. You take on my blade. You take on my voice. Yet you still speak words I've long since left behind.

10121303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	If I'm right, there must be quite a few Corrupted around here... linked to these cubes.	
10121304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	They must be the remains of that gravity core... They're adapting to Earth's environment.	
10122301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	What is this place?	
10122302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	How gorgeous and well-kept.	
10122303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Looks like we've come to a dead end... Shall we turn back?

10122306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	???	1	No, I am not Yazi.	
10122307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What do you mean? Who are you then?	
10122308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Going back will take your precious time. So if you are after the Ascendants—	
10122309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Answer my questions, and you may pass. Of course, you are also welcome to break through with force.	
10122310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Um... Do you know her?	
10122311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	...	
10122312	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	S-sort of...? (Dry laughter)	
10122313	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	So she's controlling the passage here. Alright.	
10122314	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Are you ready? Let's begin...	
10122315	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	The first question is...	
10122316	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Here comes the second question...	
10122317	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	And the third question is...	
10122318	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Light and shadow are one and the same. Where the light flourishes, the shadow also prospers.	
10122319	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	In the courtyard there is an abundance of light, in the shadows the answer hides.	
10122320	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Show me the "Lightless Veranda" should you seek the truth.	
10122321	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	That is all. Do take your time.	
10122322	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	What does "lightless" mean...? It's so bright everywhere.	
10122323	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No. There is one place without light.	
10122324	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Commandant, please make your decision.	
10122325	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Compared with the other verandas...	
10122326	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	This one isn't any different...	
10122327	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	Not quite... Just look up...	
10122328	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Oh...! I see...!	
10122329	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is what differs this veranda from the others.	
10122330	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I see... The light isn't on...	
10122331	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Is that what "lightless" meant?	
10122332	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Wind flows through the void, traveling to and fro in the courtyard.	
10122333	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	But anchored is your answer, untouched it is by ebbs and flows.	
10122334	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Yazi (?)	1	Should you desire the truth, locate the "Chamber of Windrest".	
10122335	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Lee	1	She said "windrest"... Hmm...	
10122336	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Ah, I got it! The wind must stop somewhere!	
10122337	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Commandant, we just have to find a place without wind.

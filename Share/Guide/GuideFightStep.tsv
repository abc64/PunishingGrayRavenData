102010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It doesn't matter what Cerberus is up to. We still need to investigate the source of the signal.	
102010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Corrupted have been eliminated. Anything to report, Liv?	
102010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No sign of the target "Iron Maiden" or the Construct Tifa near the signal source...	
102010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	A wasted trip, huh...	
102010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wait, is that a...?	
102010406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is it?	
102010407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	A discarded Inver-Device.	
102010408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Discarded? Why would a Construct throw away their Inver-Device?	
102020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, what's the infection status of those two Suzaku Squad Constructs?	
102020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	100%. The Punishing Virus is already taking over their bodies. Past the point of no return...	
102020103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So, besides destroying them, there's nothing else that can be done.	
102020104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe... We could try to, um... check—	
102020105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	—Check them for clues about Suzaku or Tifa... It's got to be done.	
102020106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, don't be too hard on yourself.	
102020107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commencing data extraction...

102020115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Soldier	1	Tifa! Remember what Commandant just said?!	
102020116	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tifa	1	Commandant asked us... to witness the new dawn of humanity, on his behalf...	
102020117	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tifa	1	So... I've got to... keep living... right? Only then will I... be able to... see the light of dawn...	
102020118	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Leader	1	We've got to go back.	
102020119	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tifa	1	But, Commandant's body!

102020125	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	？？？	1	And in this world, only the powerful survive.	
102020126	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Leader	1	Who... are you?	
102020127	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Soldier	1	He... stopped the Corrupted with the mere force of his presence...	
102020128	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Leader	1	Is that... the power of the Punishing Virus? How can that be?

102020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No signal?	
102020205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	His Inver-Device is broken... That's why he can't recall his consciousness or hear us.	
102020206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's impossible to defeat so many without an Iso-Device—hope he hangs in there.	
102020207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We could really use another Iso-Device round about now... Tch.

102040405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Coughs) It's getting worse... Just put me down...	
102040406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Stuff it already, Lee!	
102040407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wha?!	
102040408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll bring you back, no matter what!	
102040409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv...	
102040410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...Alright, then I'll be counting on you.	
102040411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Corrupted are closing in. We need to hurry.	
103010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Kamui, what's your status?	
103010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Uh, Chrome... I think I'm lost.	
103010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Just as I thought...	
103010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	You're good in a fight, but your sense of direction is appalling...	
103010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Listen up, Kamui, just follow the Navi-Path...	
103010106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Navi? I told you, that thing is useless. It keeps changing directions! It's so annoying...!	
103010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	Because it detects threats in real-time and adjusts your route accordingly. The Strike Hawks fight alone, after all.	
103010108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I've got my instincts! I don't need a Navi to tell me where the danger is!	
103010109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hang on. There's a Construct up ahead. I'll go ask him the way!	
103010110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Chrome	1	But there are no friendly signals in your vicinity. Hey! Can you still hear me?	
103010111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	You here on a mission too? Well, ain't that a coincidence!	
103010112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	...	
103010113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Yes. Quite.	
103010114	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'm looking for the Estate Museum. On my way to reinforce the Gray Raven. Can you point me in the right direction?	
103010115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	That way.	
103010116	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Oh, it's that way... Guess my Navi was right, after all. Good luck on your mission too, friend!	
103010117	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't mention it.	
103010118	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Well, well. They do have some interesting people on their side, don't they?	
103010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This is where the distress signal originated.	
103010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	High Construct casualties, but low levels of Punishing Virus...	
103010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Thankfully, they all recalled their consciousnesses. Their bodies weren't further infected as well.	
103010204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We should do some preliminary recovery, and find out what happened while we're at it.	
103010205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	They are covered in gunshot wounds.	
103010206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Whatever did this is packing some serious heat. Be on your guard.	
103010207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Look!	
103010208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	Heavy Terrapod	1	Visitor Identification: Thug. Commence program, "Civil Control".	
103010209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's... one of the Estate Terrapods. Someone must have reactivated it.	
103010210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	How many guns did they cram in this thing? Post-Pandemic Age tech really could use some subtlety...	
103010211	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, request backup from nearby team.	
103010212	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay!	
103010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Leave these to me!	
103010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Easy!	
103010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wow, he must be a Tank Construct... That onslaught didn't leave a scratch on him.	
103010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	(Chuckles)	
103010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate structures are falling apart, but their control systems seem pretty much intact.	
103010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Estate control systems can be accessed via that Terminal. If we can hack the defense codes, we can shut the systems down.	
103010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Is that a bionic animal? Cooool!	
103010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Wow! It's moving!	
103010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You—	
103010406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	He's activated the entire museum security system! And it's at the highest alert! That idiot...	
103020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	These exhibits... look super shady...	
103020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I won't touch them again, I swear!	
103020103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Locked... Tch, of course.	
103020104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Enemies behind us are closing in!	
103020105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No good way around this. Let's deal with them first.	
103020106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	？？？	1	That's far enough. Please leave this place, while you still can.	
103020107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Who... said that?	
103020201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The... the exhibits are being activated!	
103020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Turn on EM Camo, quickly.	
103020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Beamers ahead are hidden behind a force field. Our attacks will bounce right off.	
103020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We'll have to observe their attacks and time our exit carefully. Remember, any hits will disable our EM Camo.	
103020205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Door locks disabled. Let's keep going.	
103020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Some sort of barrier is blocking access to the courtyard...	
103020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There's a high Punishing Virus response... behind the force field.	
103020303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It must be some kind of lair.	
103020304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	It is intended to protect you... This is your last chance...	
103020305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	Once you pass through this barrier, there's no turning back.	
103020306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Liv, insert your Levi-Gun core into the Terminal. It will short the force field.	
103020307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On it.	
103020308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Estate Butler	1	...	
103020309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The force field has been overloaded. We can continue on our way!	
103020310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let's go.	
103020401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The fighting there is done. We don't have to rush. Let's clear out the Corrupted nearby first.	
103030101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Phew—mission accomplished.	
103030102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Very thorough. Thank you, Lucia.	
103030201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those Constructs... look a bit abnormal...	
103030202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Their limbs and Inver-Devices are all destroyed, but they've still got vital signs.	
103030203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay...	
103030204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What happened to you? What are you trying to say?	
103030205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Stay... back...	
103030206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Someone installed Motion Bombs inside them!	
103030207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That's so... messed... up...	
103030208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Disarming these bombs isn't possible right now... We can only give them a bit of distance...	
103030209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	That's what happens when you oppose the Ascendants—I do not wish to see it happen anymore.	
103030210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	But it's too late now. Don't say I didn't warn you.	
103030301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Loyal old Android. He has defended the Estate Museum for a very long time.	
103030302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It would have ended quite differently if he had just succumbed to the power of Ascnet.	
103030303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	But, such is the fate of the weak.	
103030304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Go. Complete your final task.	
103030305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Thank you for releasing me...	
103030306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I... will not allow... them... to defile Mr. Copperfield's legacy...	
103030307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Initiating... central nervous system... self-destruct sequence...	
103030308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Mr. Copperfield... In the end, I failed you. I couldn't protect the Estate...	
103030401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Lucia.	
103030402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What?	
103030403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Now show me what you can do.	
103030404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...	
103030405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I don't mind if the others join in, but in the end... only one of you will remain.	
103030406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	One of... us?	
103030407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Which one will it be?	
103030408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	You're weak... just like she said.	
103030409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What... are you saying?	
103030410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey punk—	
103030411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Over here!	
103030412	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What?!	
104010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You found the monitors?	
104010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Yeah... but any equipment exposed to the elements could have been infected.	
104010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hope they still work. Let me try!	
104010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	They seem to be working. It must be my lucky day.	
104010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	We should bring them in for analysis.	
104010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to find somewhere quiet. The battlefield isn't the place for computational work.	
104010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The tremors feel different here. I've got a bad feeling about this.	
104010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I'll place some EMP bombs in strategic positions.	
104010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Cover me, Lee. Don't hold back.	
104010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You got me...	
104010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Take cover! Baby's gonna blow!	
104010305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Those things don't affect us... What were you thinking?	
104010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The place is strewn with Corrupted parts...	
104010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Status?	
104010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's at 20% power. If we're doing something, now would be the time...	
104010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Emma...	
104020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's very hot here. Commandant... are you okay?	
104020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	In and out. Find a supply point for Commandant.	
104020201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Target sighted! Wow... it looks a lot bigger in real life. What's it called again?	
104020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Vassago, a kind of bionic Sand Worm. It moves through the sand and ambushes its prey.	
104020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Remain vigilant. We don't have much experience in this kind of environment.	
104020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Did you feel that, Lee?	
104020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes. EM Camo. The enemy's using military-grade tech.	
104020303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They could attack from any direction. Watch your back.	
104020304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Identifying target code... BPO-29, status... Deserter?	
104020305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	？？？	1	Lucia? It's you...	
104020306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	？？？	1	Looks like... you aren't with the cleaners.	
104020401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Kamui, don't rush in!	
104020402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Worry not! This is the part I'm actually good at!	
104020403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I don't like that... I'm getting used to his style somehow...	
104020404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Status update?	
104020405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...And they didn't even clear out the Corrupted here before telling us to set up a supply point?	
104020406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Whatever. More fun for me!	
104030101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This place will be easy to defend.	
104030102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Why do we have to do all the fighting? Are they afraid or something?

105010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I guess they know this place... Why else would they bring Liv here straight?

105020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I was just checking Kamui's Inver-Device...	
105020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It was running on high-load mode. And there are logs of him trying to turn off his GPS and Comms systems.

302010502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But we've got to stop it emitting that distress signal.	
302010503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	They just keep coming! There's no time! Take it down, Commandant!	
302010601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee still hasn't found Liv... Sorry. I shouldn't have been distracted...	
302010602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Construct models outside are no longer used in Babylonia.	
302010603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've been observing closely. There's no guards beyond the hideout. Please stay here, Commandant...	
302010604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'm going to copy their combat logs. Maybe we can get some intel...	
302010605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Unknown Construct	1	Gold... Gold...	
302010606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Unknown Construct	1	The Queen gives us... hope.	
302010607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The Queen...?	
302010701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So the Mechanoid Guards were using these secret tunnels for rapid deployment.	
302010702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The tunnels are covered in tin, blocking electrical signals of any forces moving through them.	
302010703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	Construct... are you a royal guard, or slave?	
302010704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	You sneak along behind me and never show yourself. I almost thought you were being shy.	
302010705	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	I've decided. You must be a slave.	
302010706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	The Queen... needs me...	
302010707	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She has the ability to overpower me... so why is she running?	
302010801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Fighting on constricted terrain eliminates the enemy's numerical advantage.	
302010802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But it doesn't leave much space for evasion.	
302010803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, Lee and I aren't in very good shape. For this battle, you'll need to access Construct operating systems.	
302010804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lower performance could cause Dodge lag and other problems. I'd feel better if you had access.	
302010805	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If you don't mind, Commandant...	
302010806	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Iron Maiden	1	My dream... is over...	
302010901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	I've got to reduce Construct energy consumption... to save energy...	
302010902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Always stand behind me in battle. Please don't get in my line of fire, whatever you do.	
302010903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let me take care of the fighting. I'll keep you safe.	
302011001	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's unbelievable how many guards are lurking under the sand!	
302011002	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Browning, you're in charge of the Excavator. I'll stop the guards.	
302011003	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guards have been pushed back. Browning, is everything okay?	
302011004	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Browning	1	Don't come over here!	
302011101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Huh? The combat system has security measures...?	
302011102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Why didn't Browning mention it...?	
302011103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Stay calm, Liv... I need to beat them to change the energy protocols.	
302011104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...How?!! There are no energy protocols! It's a dummy system!	
302020101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So many guards... If you can't fix the defense systems, get over here! I'm in trouble!	
302020102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I'll just grab one to examine.	
302020103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So the siren has three alarms.	
302020104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	The first two alert the guards. The third one goes to a proxy terminal.	
302020105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	This thing is basically useless now.	
302020201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Why are they all kneeling here?	
302020202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	... Besides the battle damage, they're in pretty good shape.	
302020203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	More guards... They just never end.	
302020204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Goldfinch, can your people still fight?	
302020301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	If I win, you have to come clean with me.	
302020302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Not gonna happen, because I'm not losing.	
302020303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	So many guards...	
302020304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Let bygones be bygones. I won't follow you anymore. We should go our separate ways.	
302020401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	If I'm not mistaken, these engines drive those artificial sandstorms around the Golden Vortex.	
302020402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	But it stands to reason there must be more engines to generate so many sand storms.	
302020403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	My people... probably aren't trapped here.	
302020404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I've been spotted! Better deal with these guys first...	
302020405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Did someone rob a bank? This place is crawling with guards.	
302020406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	Better rush over, just in case.	
302020501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I'm standing right in front of them and still nothing? Maybe these Mechanoids aren't guards after all.	
302020502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Looks like they've got some kind of golden ring marked on them... Hard to tell what it is.	
302020503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	What's that sound...? It's been ringing for ages...	
302020504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Da-da-di-da, di-di-da, di, di, da-di. What could it mean?	
302020601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	I'm not gonna fight you, at least not now.	
302020602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Watanabe	1	This place is crawling with guards. And I only just found my people.	
302020603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Where is he?	
302020604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	If I can flush him out, have his men draw the guards' attention, he's bound to make an appearance.

302020606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Got to make sure those guards don't hurt him.

302030604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Must have them all collapse... on the air outlets...

302040402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She must have dropped into the wrong tunnel and eventually fell there.	
302040403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She's not the type to keep quiet.	
302040404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Watch out, Nithart's guards are coming at us through the other entrance.	
302040405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	She won't let go of us easily. So get ready to fight!

302040502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Exhibit again that conceit you've shown me before, or my guards will turn you into scrap.	
302040503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Most cunning. Thankfully, I'm her opponent.	
302040504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I have to return to Commandant as quickly as possible.	
302040505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's the last...	
302040506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Nithart	1	Destroy her! This is an order from the Queen! Destroy her!	
302040601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	The virus has damaged the security process of the energy system. Our hacking is going well so far!

302040607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	This should buy some time for the Gray Raven, right?	
302040701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Unable to open?! What does that mean! I managed to crack into it...	
302040702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That's because your crack is one-way only. You can only open all security doors if you execute the crack.	
302040703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But in that case, the guards can also get in and surround us.	
302040704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	So, apart from an "open door" function, we need a "close door" one as well. The two actions must be done at the same time.	
302040705	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Easy-peasy! I can connect the two cracking devices to the same "repeater". Problem solved.	
302040706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well, repeating is the easy part. The difficult part is that the second cracking device has to connect the "closing" system.	
302040707	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As door opening and door closing are two separate systems, we can only crack it one by one.	
302040708	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Lucia and the others are defending against the guards outside. We have to crack the door closing system quickly.	
302040709	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You need to be quick. As more and more guards are trying to break through the exterior wall, they will break through our defense soon...	
302040710	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Right... But why did the crack fail? Definitely nothing to do with my devices.	
302040711	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes, Nithart crashed the system on purpose while we were cracking. That's why it failed.	
302040712	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll connect the door closing system to my virtual console. If she does that again, she'll be redirected to it.	
302040713	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Operating the final crack... Security doors opened...	
302040714	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Everyone, through the security door! Quick!	
302040715	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee...	
302040716	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Okay. Operating the final crack... Security doors closed...	
302040801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watch your front and back, the guards are tightening the encirclement...	
302040802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We have to destroy them all to prevent them from attacking the rescue aircraft.	
302040803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The royal guards are very difficult to handle. If we don't want to be attacked from both sides, we'd better concentrate our firepower on one side first.	
302040804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Commandant, quick! Which side! I'm gonna blow them all to smithereens!	
302040901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Nithart... she turned off the external sensorium of her frame.	
302040902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	She and the royal guards have already fused into one. Even if we concentrate our firepower on her, we'll still be unable to interrupt the guards' attack.	
302040903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	Just blow 'em all up!	
302040904	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami	1	Can we attack now? Nanami wants to fight!	
302040905	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The Golden Vortex will turn into an inferno soon. We'd better go now. We can't let Nithart be on our way...	
302040906	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, let's make a clean break with Nithart.

110249	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Ah... Iso-Device... It reminds me of those days with Commandant again...	
110250	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	How naive were we to believe in toys like Iso-Devices...	
110251	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Look at all these human toys... Infect them all, Corrupted!	
110252	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Right. Arm yourselves... with all the devices...

110301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Has all the fire been put off? About time to go.	
110302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What a beautiful place. Miss Luna surely has great taste.	
110303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	A pity that it will become a battlefield soon.

110307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What's the name of the machine that Gabriel hates most? Oh, "Sagemachina"... They don't look like his work though.	
110308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Which means this place has an owner.	
110309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I must pay a visit first to the owner then.

110326	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I didn't expect them to be so quick in reaction.

110335	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct Soldier	1	You bloody Corrupted... Deserves no respect!	
110336	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	How rude!

110351	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hmm? Why is there no one around?	
110352	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Greetings... You should just stay here forever.	
110353	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The normal route leads people to this fake hall...	
110354	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To enter the real guest hall, we must take a special route.	
110355	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I locked up all those Corrupted that the Estate could not destroy inside this room.	
110356	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	If those people are going to use you, I would rather you get consumed by the Corrupted...	
110357	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Did he purposely separate us?	
110358	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	What a waste of effort. I've already found you.	
110359	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	That voice sounds so familiar...	
110360	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Hey, butler. Did something happen over there?	
110361	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	He's not answering. Let's find a way out first.	
110362	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will stop you right here.	
110363	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I must protect... Mr. Copperfield's... lifelong work...

110365	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Thanks for all the joy you brought me today, Mr. Butler.	
110366	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	I'm very sorry... But I must let Punishing Virus infect you.	
110367	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	It's all for Miss Luna.	
110368	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will... never yield!	
110369	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Ugh... Aaargh!	
110370	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.

110401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Corrupted incoming... Emma... lost... Must... protect... Emma...	
110402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Go away...

110405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I need to scan Zack's memory shell before attempting to repair him.	
110406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The structure of the memory shell is simple, but for some reason, it isn't deeply infected.	
110407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's investigate together.	
110408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The tag of the important record is "Operation Grand Retreat".	
110409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing Virus has infested these data zones. The virus illusions are impacting our data query.	
110410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I've made some progress. All related data found. Loading now.	
110411	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I just need to repair one more section to start reading Zack's memories.	
110412	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Clues of... Emma's lost items...

110415	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Calculating... Completed... West halls...	
110416	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Large-scale data corruption here. Leave it to me.	
110417	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	At the end of the Post-Pandemic Age, Corrupted controlled by the Punishing Virus already had military production capabilities.	
110418	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Even with the comprehensive defense of this Estate Museum, it could not hold against the overwhelming number of Corrupted.	
110419	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	That was the situation they had to face.	
110420	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack	1	Zack... help... Emma and Copperfield... retreat...	
110421	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We've reached the deepest part of the data. The record shows Zack was already being infected at that time.	
110422	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But somehow the infection was restricted and controlled at a certain level.	
110423	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's clear the virus illusions here and read the final record.	
110424	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Zack... We are the only ones left here.	
110425	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	I will take you to the Static Lock. I hope Mr. Copperfield's research will work.	
110426	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Estate Butler	1	Before that, I just need to calm you down... I never thought we would end up like this.	
110601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recreating memory now. Hope we can find clues of the Ascendant.

110603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Punishing Virus injection complete... All weapon system activated... Increasing power output...	
110604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait, why is she using the power of Punishing Virus, but still seen as an enemy by Corrupted?	
110605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I haven't fought for a long time. Looks like... this will be my last fight.	
110606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Gargh. This power still impacts my mind... In the end, it still tests my faith...	
110607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk. I thought that God bloke abandoned me long ago...	
110608	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There are way too many Corrupted. Commandant, we should retreat now!	
110609	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	I should continue... with my final cleansing...	
110610	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Simulation in progress. Commandant, please watch closely!	
110611	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Even in this time, her frame capabilities are as good as ours in battle.	
110612	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But we have no information at all... I wonder how many secrets did the Church have in the past?	
110613	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All those Corrupted came from the machine factory's direction.	
110614	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If the source remains, their numbers would only keep growing... Exactly like what happened to us.	
110615	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Sister's destination... seems to be right there.	
110616	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Phew, just like those little brats... You always look down on adults.	
110617	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Do you know how difficult it is to be an adult...? Get out of my way!	
110618	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	...	
110619	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Tsk.	
110620	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Punishing Virus' impact must have peaked around this point.	
110621	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These are... the large firefighting robots we met before...	
110622	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yet, Punishing Virus modified them into arsonists. How ironic.	
110623	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Data interfered by virus illusions...	
110624	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. I'm activating emergency mode.	
110625	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Okay. We've seen it many times. We know what to do.	
110626	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Virus interference removed. Re-syncing now.	
110627	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, the virus infection is rooted deeply here... It needs a deep cleaning. I'll need help.	
110628	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	She managed to... hold off so many Corrupted here...	
110629	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As if she had an endless reserve of energy... Was it because of the Punishing Virus, or her own obsession?	
110630	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, it's a new combat objective!	
110631	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of broken memory probably came from when Sister was hunted by Nozzle.	
110632	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We need to manually repair the noise while tracing the memory.	
110633	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Recording complete. So this is when Sister met Nozzle.	
110634	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Next section... Okay, done.	
110635	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	After ascension, even Nozzle could use tactics against its enemy.	
110636	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The final section is also recorded.	
110637	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	There were just too many Corrupted. Even Sister had no choice but to run.	
110638	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	This is the factory's core...	
110639	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Why would humans design such a fragile structure... Once it's destroyed, everything will be lost. How unreliable.	
110640	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data shows that Sister had already reached her infection limit.	
110641	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But she hadn't completed her objective yet...	
110642	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's finish this journey with her.	
110643	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All missions in the current stage have been completed. Go to the memory breakpoint to start the next stage.	3
110644	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This piece of memory is already close to the end.	
110645	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...This should be Sister's final struggle.	
110646	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's go get her final memory.	
110647	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	
110648	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	
110649	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	
117010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory data videos show that Rohacchi found some spark falling into the ruins.	
117010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And it became very interested in it.	
117010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It then traced all the way toward the spark's landing point.	
117010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It seemed to have also activated some mechanism within the ruins...	
117010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	To further analyze the videos in this memory data...	
117010106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I will recreate the situation by video.	
117010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The memory is completely restored. Rohacchi opened this switch to move to a higher level.	3
117010108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The sealed road opened again.	3
117010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	On Rohacchi's journey, it bumped into the source of the spark and noises... It was attacked by "Roseblade".	
117010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	As expected, all the suddenly appeared Constructs were related to Ascendants. They were also after "Tenebrion".	
117010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, I suggest we carefully study the combat data against "Roseblade". It will benefit our subsequent operations.	
117010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Rohacchi seemed to have met similar-looking machines.	
117010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It thought they were its own kind and went up to them.	
117010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Only to be met with sudden assault.	
117010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Subsequent memory data has been deciphered. Transforming to digital video now.	
117010305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	In the memory, IX-68 squatted next to one of its "kin," slowly patting its body...	
117010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Here, Rohacchi met Nanami...	
117010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And suddenly attacked...!?	
117010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Perhaps we could find more information about Nanami from this memory.	
117010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The battle didn't last long, and Nanami seemed to have moved together with Rohacchi for some time.	
117010501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the memory, Rohacchi and Nanami defeated many Corrupted and returned to the upper level of the ruins.	
117010502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Looks like the "mural" they were talking about must be nearby.	
117010503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'll continue with my analysis, Commandant. Please look out for any info related to the "mural" that caused them to awaken.	
117010601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to Rohacchi's memory, this should be where they first saw the mural.	
117010602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But when it took Nanami there, they found nothing.	
117010603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Apart from those machines wandering nearby.	
117010604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Maybe the ruins collapsed because of us, so the murals also fell to another location.	
117010605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No matter what, this piece of memory is worth studying again.	
118010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I found well-preserved facilities underneath the ruins.	
118010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I tried my best to stay awake.	
118010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I knew I didn't have much time left.	
118010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	So I had to break away from the Corrupted ASAP.	
118010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	One after another. Aren't you all tired??	
118010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Why don't you just come all together? At least it can save some time.	
118010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I must keep moving. No one can stop me.	
118010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	At the bottom of the ruins, I found a long and narrow corridor. Unlike the upper levels, the facilities there were kept very well.	
118010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I was exhausted from non-stop fighting.	
118010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Those Corrupted seemed to have noticed this too, and launched an assault together.	
118010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Tsk, the number just keeps growing...	
118010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Looks like you need my help.	
118010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I know what you're planning. I'm not done yet!	
118010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Hah, you bluff. I know full well about your body.	
118010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	...I will never let the virus infect me.	
118010501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Karenina	1	You, stop right there!	
118010502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	I was shocked to hear such a loud voice. Never thought she would catch up so quickly.	
118010503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	And thanks to her, all the wandering Corrupted came up to us. The only thought I had was to never let them get me.	
118010601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	After getting rid of all the annoying Corrupted, Camu launched his final attack too.	
118010602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	He was far more powerful than me. I knew about that. All too well.	
118010603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	But I had my reasons to fight too...	
118010604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kamui	1	Of course I would not fall so easily! Because I must be myself!	
999401501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Tifa	1	Commandant... You are finally here...	
999401502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Sister	1	Take me along, and cleanse this planet!	
999401503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Camu	1	Am I Kamui or not? That doesn't matter.

311010106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	So you've been listening... Fine. Can't you be a bit more passionate to your comrades?	
311010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	If you don't have anything important, I'll hang up. I'm very busy.

311010111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	Don't you know? We noticed that your coordinates were moving through the Pacific Ocean over the last week...	
311010112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Roland	1	So what's going on with you?	
311010113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I'm on the back of a Narwhal.

311010115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I've already controlled its diving module. Maybe three more days...

311010123	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	The fact that it was attacked by the Corrupted proves this.

311010204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So the defense mechanism's stopped working. Aren't the humans here going to do something about it?	
311010205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we've done it! All defense machines are back in order.

311010503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That white-haired Ascendant is there... I can't miss the opportunity.	
311010504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Understood. We will try our best to hold her up for you.	
311010505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'll be back ASAP...!	
311010506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	...You aren't going through.	
311010507	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Leave her alone. We'll be your opponent!	
311010508	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	No... We can't stop her... She's too powerful...!	
311010509	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Wait...! What are those... in the sea?!	
311010510	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	In the sea...? A raging tide?!	
311010511	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	Rosetta	1	...Derek!	
311010601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Gray Raven, thanks for your help...	
311010602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Please, hold against the Corrupted!	
311010603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Everybody, defend the port!	
311010604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Nascal!	
311010605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The Forest Guards are suffering casualties!	
311010701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Our battle isn't over!	
311010702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	If you call that a battle.	
311010703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	You are not even half as good as her.	
311010704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Do you even understand what you have done...?	
311010705	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	You are my enemy, and I'm going to defeat you. This will never change!	
311010706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	...You never learn.	
311010707	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	I made her an Ascendant in order to save her.	
311010708	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	But because of what you did...	
311010709	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	She will become a mindless puppet controlled by the Punishing Virus instead.	
311010710	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Ugh...!	
311010711	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	But so what...? Both the Corrupted and the so-called Ascendants are the enemy of humans.	
311010712	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Is that so... Whatever.	
311010713	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Just stay there and watch. This is the difference between us.	
311010714	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Lucia	1	Why am I... drawn to her...	
311010801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Hmph. Even as a puppet...	
311010802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	You still know who's the strong one...	
311010803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	α	1	Let's end it then.	
309010101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It's been a while since I last came here.	
309010102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What is this place, Diana...?	
309010103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	During the early outbreak of the Punishing Virus, Murmansk was once very prosperous due to its geographical advantages.	
309010104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	It absorbed many inland cities and formed a commonwealth. This place was part of the northeast commonwealth.	
309010105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	And one of the birthplaces of Forest Guard.	
309010106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's no time for nostalgia... We are followed.	
309010107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Smells like a prey...	
309010108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Forest Guards, continue tracing forward. Stay close to the target...	
309010109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Gray Raven will bring up the rear and deal with the enemies in the shadows!	
309010201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The target is not far ahead, but why didn't you ask the Forest Guard to follow up?	
309010202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	You said Evan was on his feet. There's no way he could lose the Corrupted.	
309010203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	But we didn't see him when we locked on to the target...	
309010204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Something's not right.	
309010205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Our target is running away!	
309010206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hesitation will only lead to failure. Go! Stop it!	
309010301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Evan can't just disappear!	
309010302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	There must be other clues nearby. Forest Guards! Spread out!	
309010303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Search everywhere! Everywhere!	
309010304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Someone found a 5cm long, shattered titanium plate...	
309010305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please let me take a look!	
309010306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	...Yes! There's human sebum and hair on the edges.	
309010307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	That's our first clue! We are on the right track!	
309010308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Looking for clues help, but the longer we stay here, the easier we may become the target instead...	
309010309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee, are you talking about the wandering Corrupted in the forest?	
309010310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Not just the forest. They could also be among the snowy rocks, even river beds.	
309010311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant! Please stay alerted!	
309010312	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	I'm about to process the human pheromones found on these parts...	
309010313	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Diana, please give me Evan's weapon. I need to collect his pheromones.	
309010314	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The two samples matched perfectly! Evan was here! Now I can make a pheromone detector.	
309010315	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Is that...?	
309010316	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As long as Evan is still breathing, we can detect the pheromone he produces.	
309010317	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Found him!!	
309010318	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	He's trapped on the shell of the Corrupted. Why...? Are they using him to protect themselves?	
309010319	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Adjust your equipment immediately! Only melee weapons are allowed. We must not hurt humans!	
309010401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I can't cut through these metal bones without hurting the rescue target.	
309010402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our only option is to make a strategic relocation. Take it back to the Forest Guard stronghold first, then we can think of another way.	
309010403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Lee... How's his health doing?	
309010404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Don't worry, he's not infected. Just a little hypothermia.	
309010405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Strong Punishing reaction detected nearby! Everyone, watch out!	
309010406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	The Corrupted are still killing.	
309010407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Diana, please join us and form a line of defense together.	
309010408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We must not let Corrupted hurt humans.	
309010501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	The Forest Guard acknowledges Liv's strategic vision.	
309010502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	My sisters and I will do all we can to assist Gray Raven's rescue plan.	
309010503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Calculations complete. The enemy's weak points are its supporting legs.	
309010504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Diana	1	Sisters! Focus fire on the supporting legs!	
309010505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Wait a sec. Mr. Lee didn't include Evan in his calculation...	
309010506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Some of those legs are very close to Evan's location.	
309010507	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please, everyone, don't hurt Evan.	
10099001	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That cross-shaped terminal has caused other devices to enter waved status.	4
10099002	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Affected devices are immune to most of our attacks.	4
10099003	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Attack the cross-shaped terminal continuously to remove this status from them.	6
10099004	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The light beams radiated from the Heteromer Terminal will repair the Heteromer devices.	5
10099005	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	But be careful, these beams contain viruses that will cause our bionic nerves to have stress reaction if we get hit directly.	6
10099006	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Commandant of Gray Raven, these oddly shaped terminals are able to split.	5
10099007	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The polar electric current circulated between them can paralyze Construct's bionic nerves and reduce their mobility.	5
10099008	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	But consecutive attacks can reverse their electrode.	4
10099009	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	If they appear in this form, try to fight them off in this way.	4
10090101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the map, we've landed at the designated location—	
10090102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The data analysis cabin on space station.	
10090103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But... our aircraft has been destroyed...	
10090104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If we can destroy the space station's defense system, we're able to retreat when the main forces arrive.	
10090105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	These terminals seem bizarre...	
10090106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Those are what the report said—the corruption occurred on this space station only.	
10090107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You must be careful, Lee.	
10090108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is...!	
10090109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	More authorities unlocked...	
10090110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait, that cross is guarding the gate...	
10090111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to my preliminary scan result, this type of enemy doesn't have a typical mechanical structure inside its body...	
10090112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It is... composed entirely of Punishing Virus...	
10090113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This space station must be hiding some important secrets...	
10090114	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems we can do more than just destroying it.	
10090115	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Guys, I've turned off the space station's remote sensing system.	
10090116	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090117	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It should be able to reduce its attacks against Babylonia.	
10090118	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, this is the first step for us.	
10090201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We arrived at the second target location—	
10090202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	According to the analysis, here is the weapon control system backend...	
10090203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	After the space station being conrrupted.	
10090204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There remain many inactivated Heteromers...	
10090205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	If they become enemies just like...	
10090206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Have you noticed that cross-shaped enemy in the middle?	
10090207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Although we're not at all clear about the mechanism...	
10090208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	this type of enemy seems to control the spawning of other enemies, and—	
10090209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	The key to dealing with our problems, I understood...	
10090210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those black pillars... decompose... reconstruct...	
10090211	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Every bit of the Hetero-matter of Punishing Virus in this space station could become our enemy...	
10090212	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Our attacks can make them remain inactive—	
10090213	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	At least we found a way, right?	
10090214	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Yep, let's continue in this way.	
10090215	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Finally...	
10090216	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah... Some Hetero-matter have regenerated energy and started to act again!	
10090217	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tch, at this rate, we'll be drained sooner or later...	
10090218	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, access the control system directly. Lee—	
10090219	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I understood.	
10090220	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's done!	
10090221	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	All close-range firepower for interception purposes has been turned off!	
10090222	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Well done, Liv.	
10090223	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The subsequent troops have begun to issue a new assembly signal.	
10090224	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We don't have to fight purely on our own at last.	
10090301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	However, you seem to have much trouble here.	
10090302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's skip chit-chatting—	
10090303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	And see this as my gift for you.	
10090304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Those enemies have shown a new attack mode.	
10090305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But Watanabe has already been able to cope with them...	
10090306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	You’re so strong...	
10090307	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It feels completely different from the time we met him before.	
10090308	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	So, is everything fine?	
10090309	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	...	
10090310	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Should I say thanks to you?	
10090311	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Hmph, still quite energetic.	
10090401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	...From here on, it'll be a bit different.	
10090402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The gate is locked by encryption, which means it's Lee's turn.	
10090403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	(Analyzing...)	
10090404	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I... see...	
10090405	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's four corrupted terminals right in the four corners of this compartment.	
10090406	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Varied combinations can be produced by switching their respective forms...	
10090407	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Let's try different combinations.	
10090408	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The encryption has been cracked, but it causes those Heteromers to enter defense mode...	
10090409	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Anyway, we made certain progress.	
10090410	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Let’s finish the remaining enemies.	
10090411	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Levels, huh? The mysterious blocks on the terminal might be the key.	3
10090412	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It appears that interacting with the terminal can change the shape of the block...	3
10090413	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So we have to make a selection from those shapes...	3
10090414	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Maybe something unexpected would happen if we leave a certain number of blocks in the corresponding shapes.	3
10090501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Lucia... Why is she so enthusiastic...	
10090502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I see. It's a challenge, isn't it? Hmph...	
10090503	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	All right, I accept it—Let's see who can sweep the enemies away faster.	
10090504	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	How's it? I haven't disappointed you, have I?	
10090505	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Impressive.	
10090506	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's work together to protect Liv from the last wave of attacks.	
10090507	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	On it.	
10090508	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Maybe my life is for this moment...	
10090509	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	What did you say, Watanabe?	
10090510	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Nothing.	
10090601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	You... haven't complied with... the regulations...	
10090602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Now... Kids... come to the confinement cabin with Korolev...	
10090603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Accept your punishment...	
10090604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	If any resistance occurs... Korolev will follow the rules... to adopt the minimum enforcement measures...	
10090605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, this... is...?	
10090606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not composed of Hetero-matter. It's a real Corrupted... I'm afraid...	
10090607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It is the annoying broadcast we've been listening to all the time?	
10090608	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But, in such high viral density environment... Can a machine truly maintain its original consciousness?	
10090609	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It strikes me that... it's been held in captivity alone... What could be the reason for that...	
10090610	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	We might have no answers to it... All I know now is that we only have one choice...	
10090611	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Korolev	1	Confinement...	
10090701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The surrounding gravity becomes abnormal...	
10090702	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The core of space station... Gravity room. We finally made it.	
10090703	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	It's the gravity experiment here that produces Hetero-matter—	
10090704	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Who would have thought humans would not only suffer from Punishing Virus but also help it create a new form...	
10090705	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Watanabe... Thank you for fighting with us all this way...	
10090706	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Don't worry, I won't leave until the threat of this space station is resolved.	
10090707	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I know those enemies were just warm-up for you.	
10090708	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's show our true power to them now.	
10090709	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	These crosses... appear again...	
10090710	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's like their presence is conveying a certain "message"...	
10090711	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Commandant, we can't go any further...	
10090712	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This is an artificially designed area. Now that we've dispatched the enemies—	
10090713	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	The mechanism should be able to resume normal operation.	
10090714	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Try to get close to the edge.	
10090715	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What a stunning design...	
10090716	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It is achieved only by precise gravity manipulation...	
10090717	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I remember there's gravity generators inside Babylonia as well.	
10090718	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yes... But I never thought I would be so close to its prototype...	
10090719	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I've tried it out. It's fine to go—	
10090720	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Keep on going!	
10090721	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This is...	
10090722	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Some kind of mechanism again... Should take a look at it.	
10090723	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It's a device used to lock those rings.	
10090724	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	In such a way, it can stabilize the rings and gravity core.	
10090725	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Those rings are nearly the same. Let's continue in this way.	
10090726	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Yes...	
10090801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	I'm not sure what would happen if you operated it incorrectly...	
10090802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	But please follow my instructions.	
10090803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	The first message is—	
10090804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	"Two into one".	
10090805	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Do you have any idea about it?	
10090806	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It seems to be related to these light beams...	
10090807	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll try to crack it forcibly, but it's going to take some time.	
10090808	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It might trigger a higher level of defense system. Anyway, let's get through this together, Commandant.	
10090809	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	It worked.	
10090810	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Miss Ayla, please provide the next instruction!	
10090811	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, the next message is—	
10090812	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	"From abstract to concrete".	
10090813	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Abstract and concrete... We've encountered enemies that gave us similar feelings.	
10090814	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Which means... "Starting from the abstract"?	
10090815	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Let's do it then!	
10090816	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We can move on now!	
10090817	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The path is blocked off again.	
10090818	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	As you can see... There's three movable mechanisms...	
10090819	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yes!	
10090820	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	According to the record, the tip here is—	
10090821	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	"The beginning is the end".	
10090822	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Hmm, I think I've figured it out...	
10090823	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Same as before, I'll try to crack it forcibly.	
10090824	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	As expected, you solved the puzzle first, Commandant.	
10090825	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Ah, here we're again...	
10090826	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	It should be the last mechanism for this ring.	
10090827	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Please tell us the last tip.	
10090828	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	Okay, listen carefully—	
10090829	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ayla	1	"Divide is complete".	
10090830	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's getting hard to understand...	
10090831	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	But experience told us we have to create a certain pattern using these light beams.	
10090832	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Although I'm not quite certain about it, I think we should create as much "divide" as possible.	
10090833	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Backend hacking is also in progress.	
10090834	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	So, it's... correct?	
10090835	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Yep, well done!	
10090836	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...	
10090837	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	The mechanism that controls the rings appeared.	
10090838	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Let's resume.	
10090839	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Only a few rings left.	
10090840	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hm, we'd better hurry. Other troops should be on their way now.	
10090841	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	No matter what enemies are waiting for us at the end,	
10090842	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	This time, we have many teammates on our side.	
10090843	0	Guide/Guide2	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hmm... maybe it's implying that we have to create a certain pattern.	3
10090844	0	Guide/Guide3	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Two into... Maybe it's something about the number of light beams.	3
10090845	0	Guide/Guide4	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	One could represent a circle, but what does it have to do with the tip?	3
10090846	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Separated in two paths, a single straight line. It feels like we almost find the answer.	3
10090847	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	If it's translated literally... the beginning represents the end?	3
10090848	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	If the cross lines are connected... It kind of makes sense.	3
10090849	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Ring structure...? Could it be a clue to solve this puzzle?	3
10090850	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Making it a circulation seems to match the tip...	3
10090851	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Connecting it in another way might worth a try...	3
10090852	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Maybe we should make the straight lines at the beginning into something else?	3
10090853	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Light beams... Prism... Three points... Perhaps we can indeed change something...	3
10090854	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Make that single... No, two merged light beams split. Perhaps... Maybe...	3
10090855	0	Guide/Guide1	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I will hack into it from the backend now.	3
10090901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The enemies this time seem different...	
10090902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They haven't decomposed upon being defeated. Instead—	
10090903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	They entered a state similar to hibernation... Energy flowed steadily inside their body...	
10090904	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	No more path occurs ahead. Perhaps it is because of this kind of enemy.	
10090905	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, I don't know what you're thinking of it, but we'd better act with caution.	
10090906	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After all, this enemy has appeared with certain modifications.	
10090907	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Wait... Are they... coming to us?	
10090908	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	But they haven't shown any intention to assault...	
10090909	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	It's impossible for Punishing Virus not to show any aggressiveness.	
10090910	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	Unless...	
10090911	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	What's concerning you, Watanabe?	
10090912	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	...	
10090913	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I'll speak for him—Unless it's their "choice".	
10090914	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Punishing Virus' choice? You mean Punishing Virus is able to make a choice?	
10090915	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	It's a feature of possessing consciousness. But...	
10090916	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	I don’t know... I'm afraid no one can explain this situation clearly.	
10090917	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	We can only go forward now.	
10090918	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The path occurs. The energy inside these enemies has been transferred to the mechanism...	
10090919	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	And flowed into its central core.	
10090920	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Watanabe	1	It sounds terribly bad...	
10090921	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	That core is the primary target in this assault ordered by Babylonia.	
10090922	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	At least... We're getting closer to our ultimate target.

10090924	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Then, this is the last mechanism.	
10090925	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After passing through this, we'll face the largest Heteromer parasitic on the gravity core.	
10090926	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Any hesitation is unnecessary at this point.	
10090927	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...Gray Raven, prepare for battle!	
30150101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Mr. Lee truly never misses a shot!	
30150102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I won't waste a single bullet.	
30150103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Mission complete. Prepare to retreat. Commandant should be waiting for us outside here.	
30150104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct A	1	Mr. Lee, it seems we've been going round in circles...

30150106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	This way.	
30150107	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct B	1	Hey, I heard Mr. Lee has no sense of direction. It isn't true, is it? (Softly)	
30150108	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Remaining Heteromers discovered ahead. Everyone, ready to engage.	
30150109	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Constructs	1	Roger!	
30150110	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Commandant, we've arrived at the designated location. Nearby devices show apparent traces of being tampered by Gabriel.	
30150111	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	All devices are expected to be recovered in five minutes.	
30150112	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	After this, Engineering Force can "touch down" on the space station and carry out their duties...	
30150113	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Construct	1	Mr. Lee! Nearby devices have returned to operation all of a sudden!	
30150114	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Tsk, what a tedious parting gift.	
10100101	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This... This is!?	
10100102	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	A hideous appearance indeed.	
10100103	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing concentration surging!	
10100104	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Commandant, please stay back. This enemy has extremely high lethality.	
10100105	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's not working. Our attacks hardly deal any damage to it.	
10100106	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Sounds like a train is approaching...	
10100201	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	This train is...?	
10100202	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Focus. The enemies aren't finished yet.	
10100203	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Punishing concentration continues to surge... It's corrupting the new train!	
10100204	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Liv, prepare sufficient Serum. We'll go after it.	
10100205	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	There's an excessive amount of Corrupted, which will slow us down.	
10100206	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	I propose that we adjust the operation, passing through inside the train to intercept our target.	
10100207	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	By doing so, we can avoid the risk of moving on the rooftop of a high-speed train.	
10100208	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	...A decorated glass cupola.	
10100209	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	It's beautiful.	
10100210	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We can go inside the train from here as we also have to get in touch with the owners of this train.	
10100301	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	The mechanoids... are fighting the Corrupted?	
10100302	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lee	1	Those mechanoids should have been used in repairs.	
10100303	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Secure the train compartments. We can't let them reach the crowded area.	
10100304	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll help handle the threats coming from another side. You guys can stop that large prey outside.	
10100305	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	That Corrupted in the corner is corrupting other mechanoids in normal operation!	
10100306	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	We can't leave it alone.	
10100401	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Please beware of the Corrupted coming down from the ceiling.	
10100402	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	There's not much time left. We must stop the Rail Heterozygote, otherwise, this train will be in great danger.	
10100403	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Sophia	1	I'll bring up the rear.	
10100501	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee	1	Beware, they're charging at us.	
10100502	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Ready to fight!	
10100601	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Bianca, your current location was once a temporary supply deport.	
10100602	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	According to the signal sent back by Liv, that train will pass through here soon.	
10100603	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	I also have a piece of bad news for you. The leader of Gray Raven seems to have gone missing.	
10100604	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Lucia?	
10100605	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	Anyway, your prime objective remains to secure the train station, then you can move when you find a good timing.	
10100606	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Celica	1	I will keep updating you on the target info.	
10100607	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Target confirmed. Prepare to execute the purification mission.	
10100608	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's been a long time since I used this frame.	
10100609	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Hope I can still handle it.	
10100610	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The tunnel portal is sealed by a gate.	
10100611	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It doesn't stand to reason that a gate is set to block off the rail in a train station.	
10100612	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's like a device added at a later stage.	
10100613	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	I have to find a way to turn it on, otherwise when the train arrives...

10100615	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Everything seems to have remained the same.	
10100616	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Then, I only have to wait on the second floor.	
10100617	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Gronin Station was once its name.	
10100618	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	According to the vaguely discernible information, it was a rare oasis in this boundless desert.	
10100619	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	As a temporary supply deport, it was a lively venue that provided supplies and energy for the trains during the Golden Age.	
10100620	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	After the outbreak of the virus, it was also used as a temporary refugee camp for the victims of this disaster.	
10100621	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	...Although it has already become a nest of Corrupted.	
10100622	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	But it can still resist wind erosion and manage to maintain its original appearance.	
10100701	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Not much time left. I have to destroy the remaining Corrupted as soon as possible.	
10100801	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	This area is full of Corrupted too...	
10100802	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	The situation is more serious than I thought.	
10100803	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Target confirmed in the Hawkeye sight distance.	
10100804	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	That is Rail Heterozygote...	
10100805	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	This location is not suitable for shooting, and its weak points are still uncertain.	
10100806	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	If I could get closer.

10100808	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Bianca, jump!	
10100901	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	It's still out of the shooting range. We have to move closer.	
10100902	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Hold me tight!	
10100903	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Target locked. Ready to break its defense.	
10100904	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	I'll drive it. You concentrate on your work!	
10101001	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	We did it! It's stopped!	
10101002	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee	1	...But the cost is too high.	
10101003	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Liv	1	Lee...	
10101004	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee	1	I know. It isn't the time for sorrow as the mission isn't over yet.	
10101005	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lucia	1	Right, we have to root out the potential threats left by us.	
10101006	0	Guide/Guide1	2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Bianca	1	Ready for sniping. Everyone, please assume your position.

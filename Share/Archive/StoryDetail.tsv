100407	1004	19	Forsaken	4_7 			Identity... deserter?	84100407		1100423	3100423
100408	1004	20	Negotiation	4_8 			Next time we meet, we'll be enemies.	84100408		1100424	3100424
100409	1004	21	Left Behind	4_9 			When Gray Raven almost escaped, Liv was captured by the Forsaken.	84100409		1100431	3100431

100501	1005	25	Traces	5_1 			Without Liv, Gray Raven can only stay in place and wait for Kamui's results.	84100501		1100511

100710	1007	58	Besieged	7_10 			The enemies were coming at Gray Raven once Karenina's condition was stabilized. Seeing that they moved in coordination, there must be someone behind them.	84100710		1100732

100805	1008	65	Weeping Rose	8_5 			After Nozzle is the robot butler of the same model as the butler back in the Estate. It seems that "someone" does not want Gray Raven to find Kamui.	84100805		1100821	3100821
100806	1008	66	Path of Torture	8_6 			It proved that those Corrupted were made by Roland through some unknown means. Suddenly, Lee left the team just like Kamui had done.	84100806		1100822	3100822

100811	1008	71	Devoured	8_11 			I did it with my will and fought so from the beginning till now!	84100811		1100833	3100833
100812	1008	72	Light and Shadow	8_12 			Because, you are me, and I am you. We're both Kamui.	84100812		1100834	3100834

100906	1009	78	Digit Blade	9_6 			If there is any danger, Commandant, please wake us immediately.	84100906		1100916	
100907	1009	79	Strict Education	9_7 			This high-density body plans to give Gray Raven a lesson.	84100907		1100917

101002	1010	87	To Akdilek	10_2 			Akdilek Commercial Alliance... Wait, this diagram, is a train?	84101002		1101012	
101003	1010	88	Constructs on Earth	10_3 			Are you surprised? Construct Tech is not something only Babylonia has.	84101003		1101013	3101013
101004	1010	89	A Trade with Akdilek	10_4 			After all, that is our most valuable merchandise.	84101004		1101014	3101014

200505	2005	120	Lost	5_5 			Only if she could find her way back to her M.I.N.D.	84200505		1110521	
200506	2005	121	Swallowed	5_6 			The pseudo-consciousness of Liv reforms itself, and attempts to close off the M.I.N.D. entrance...!	84200506		1110522	3110522
200601	2006	122	Sister	6_1 			Because machines would never waver in their faith, they proved more reliable than any normal human believer.	84200601		1110611	
200602	2006	123	Child	6_2 			But have you ever seen this many plump and well-fed kids queuing up?	84200602		1110612

200604	2006	125	Blade	6_4 			A pair of bladed wings spread out of her back. She leaps and dives into the Corrupted-filled abyss down below.	84200604		1110614	
200605	2006	126	Against the Current	6_5 			Well, I'm not going back anyway. Might as well play a little with this power.	84200605		1110615	
200606	2006	127	Ending	6_6 			Serving God and humans as a machine for my entire life, was there even any meaning to this?	84200606			3110616
200701	2007	128	Recurrence	7_1 			This is Rohacchi's memory data I copied from the ruins. Now rendering it into visual data for replay.	84200701		1110711

200705	2007	132	Treasure Hunt	7_5 			Looks like Rohacchi's awakening has something to do with that mysterious mural.	84200705		1110721	
200706	2007	133	Fantasy	7_6 			In the end, we couldn't find any relevant information about the murals...	84200706			3110722
200801	2008	134	Report	8_1 			Chrome, too... He knows full well I'm not familiar with these things.	84200801		1110811

201001	2010	143	Threat	10_1 			Heads up, the Corrupted are invading!	84201001		1111011	
201002	2010	144	Spider	10_2 			Hetero activity detected... It's similar to the egg hatching process of an arthropod.	84201002		1111012	
201003	2010	145	Obstacles	10_3 			Enemies have been swarming towards Changyu on the train roof. Sophia decided to split up from Gray Raven in the nick of time.	84201003		1111013	
201004	2010	146	Return	10_4 			While you, on the other hand, rest.	84201004		1111014	
201005	2010	147	Deviate	10_5 			Changyu's situation is a bit dire and requires emergency maintenance.	84201005		1111021	
201006	2010	148	Decision	10_6 			The parts of the external mechanic arms can be replaced with the mechanical equipment lying around.	84201006		1111022	3111022
201101	2011	149	Entry	11_1 			"Don't worry, I'm Executive Officer Nikola's agent."	84201101		YC01101BA	YC01101EA
201102	2011	150	Disguise	11_2 			Don't move. First, let's fit your head through this hole in the dress...	84201102		YC01102BA	YC01102EA
201103	2011	151	Mesmerized	11_3 			They're all trapped in this place, yet they're excited as ever for this event. Are they controlled too deep—or are they poisoned by this dream?	84201103		YC01103BA	
201104	2011	152	Confusion	11_4 			Two similar yet vastly different souls sit together, back to back, seeing entirely different worlds.	84201104			YC01104EA
201105	2011	153	Diminishing	11_5 			The dream wasn't good enough. That's all.	84201105		YC01105BA	YC01105EA
201201	2012	154	Trojan Horse	12_1 			The Forest Guards followed the Corrupted to Kowloong City.	84201201		YC01201BA	
201202	2012	155	Trapped Hound	12_2 			Who was the real prey? Cerberus, or Roland?	84201202		YC01202BA	
201203	2012	156	Gold & Centaur	12_3 			"I want you to join us in this battle, Rosetta."	84201203		YC01203BA	YC01203EA
201204	2012	157	Fireworks	12_4 			Finally, it was time for Cerberus to strike back.	84201204		YC01204BA	
201205	2012	158	Deceptor	12_5 			Lamia owed Watanabe a favor.	84201205		YC01205BA	
201206	2012	159	Another Ending	12_6 			The war was coming to an end. Everybody had their own thoughts and plans.	84201206		YC01206BA	
201207	2012	160	Seize	12_7 			Gabriel's giant arm pierced through Qu's chest...	84201207		YC01207BA	YC01207EA

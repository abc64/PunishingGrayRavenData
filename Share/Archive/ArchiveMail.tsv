Yarrumph... Nanami went a-playing with Ka-ku-ro—yawn—K-Karen the whooole day and we pew-pewed so many fireworks! Oh! But Commandant, don't tell Celica we blew up the CIC holo-display...\nNhn... Yawn... Anyways, Nanami is getting all snoozy-doozy, so I'm doing this early and going to sleepy town... The others who stayed home all day and got no play can do the countdowns or wossname instead! Huehuehue, Nanami's New Year greeting though, wins the race! Be Nanami's good human research subject this year too, Commandant!\n\nNa★na★mi★	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png
102	1			2	Lucia New Year Mail	Lucia	Dear Commandant:\n\nHappy New Year, Commandant. It's quite lively outside...\nYou must be busy responding to the New Year messages from everyone by now.\nLooking back, we went through a lot in the last year, and I've learnt a lot as well.\nThinking of our times together makes me all warm inside... I'll treasure these memories forever.\nAnd thank you for telling me about past culture, Commandant. Like this New Year.\nWe can still smile and be happy like the people of the past, even in this stricken world of ours.\nIn the past, I would not have realized the importance of the minutest joys, but you and Gray Raven made me realized how priceless they are.\nI will continue fighting alongside you as a proof of my resolve.\nSo, Commandant, please lead us forward in the coming year as well.\n\n*Attached is an obviously handmade lipsticked frog plushie. A small L is sewn on its back.*\n\nLucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png
103	1			3	Karenina New Year Mail	Karenina	*The following message is a transcript created by a speech recognition program*\nBoom——Bzzz——Boom——\nHello? Hello? You hear me? Alright! Here it is! The fireworks I promised.\nPhew, good thing I made it. Nanami nearly messed it all up!\nSo HEY, drop a Happy New Year for me at least, yeah?!\nI gotta be the first to get presents and blessings, you got it?!\n\nOh, and this thing's for you. Don't you snitching to Celica about my fireworks, alright?! Or you're going to PAY!\n\nKarenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png
104	1			4	Karenina New Year Mail	Karenina	——****! ——****! ——****! GAAAAAHH——!\nONE MINUTE PASSED ALREADY! Lucia didn't get the first New Year greeting in before me, did she?! Hey! Did she?!\nArrrgh, this'll have to do! HEY! LISTEN UP!\n——Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year!\nHowzat! That's got to have beaten Lucia in terms of Happy New Years!\n\nKarenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png
105	1			5	Lee New Year Mail	Lee	Dear Commandant:\n\nAccording to <Babylonia Residential Regulations and Restrictions>, the damage to public facilities and decibel levels caused by Nanami and Karenina last night has clearly exceeded the "agreeably acceptable" standard. Through computational analysis derived from witness statements and database information, there is a high possibility that, Commandant, you, will be deemed as the person in charge.\nAs such, in the following few days, Babylonia Regional Administrations has a 66.3% chance to request from you a statement of responsibility, explanation of circumstances, and other such relevant information. I have already prepared all the possible documents you might require, and you need only sign your name on them. I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call "Lunar New Year".\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together. Your command decisions have brought us victory and hope.\nYour efforts were not unrecognized by us.\nWell... It all feels quite new and awkward writing it this way.\nBut anyhow, good work for the last year, Commandant.\nHappy New Year.\n\nLee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png
106	1			6	Liv New Year Mail	Liv	Dearest Commandant:\n\nGood morning, Commandant. A new year has come.\nI hope you slept well last night.\nDid you know? There is an Eastern custom in the past known as "Bai Nian". People would gather on New Year's Eve and celebrate the coming of the New Year. They would greet and give each other their blessings, thanking them for their kindness in the last year.\nThis is our first New Year together, Commandant. Karen told me that fireworks can be used to bring good luck, but, fireworks are so transient... which is why I'd like to give you with something more long-lasting...\nI tried making a New Year present for you. It's not much, but it'll please me greatly if you like it.\nThank you for the time we spent together. I'm infinitely grateful that you became Gray Raven's commandant—our commandant.\nPlease lead us forward in the coming year too.\nHappy New Year\n\nLiv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png
107	1			7	Kamui New Year Mail	Kamui	Dear Commandant:\nCOMMANDANT!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! HAHA! it was so fun playing card games with you and Lee last night!

108	1			8	Bianca New Year Mail	Bianca	Dear Gray Raven's commandant:\n\nI am writing with regards to the Christmas invitation from the Gray Raven squad in the recent past. I have received the invitation, but due to Purifying Force duties concerning the safety of Babylonia officials during the holidays, I could only arrange for Karenina to join you.\nKarenina has expressed that it was a joyous event, and I am sorry for being unable to make it.\nMy shift has just ended, and I hope that this message is not too late for the New Year.\nDue to the nature of the Purifying Force's work, we have always been shunned by others, be it humans or Constructs. It is better for us that way as well. This is also part of the reason why we are usually dispatched during the festivities.\nYet, after knowing more about the Gray Raven and you, I seem to be having a change of hearts on how I feel about the matter... which is a change that I do not dislike.\nTo me, praying is nothing more than a habit, but I still pray, from the bottom of my heart, for your safety in the coming days.\nIf the circumstances permit in the next year, and as an apology for my absence in the Christmas gathering, could I ask you to join me in a short vacation together?\n\nHappy New Year.\nBianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png
109	1			9	Watanabe New Year Mail	Watanabe	Dear Gray Raven's commandant:\nSorry. I finally found the time to send you a mail. No, I didn't forget about the occasion. Humans might be having their festivals, that's all good and all, but the Corrupted don't get day-offs. If we don't thoroughly clean up the area around the Oasis, it might even mess with your satellites. You probably wouldn't want extra work because of some Forsaken issues too.\nOh, and please keep your squad members in check. When I heard the explosions at night, I thought the Corrupted were knocking on our door. I got my gear and everything ready, only to find your two trouble-making lasses shooting fireworks into the sky. "It looks the best at this angle!" or something, they said...\nI know you might want to spoil them a little as their commandant, but as a leading figure, you might be too lenient on them. You make a mistake, you get disciplined. That's how it should go in the army.\nBabylonia's holidays should be over soon. You must be exhausted from playing hard during the vacation, so you should just rest in the last few days to prepare for work. I'd rather not have to stand in and clean up some new mess for Babylonia once your holidays end. And on an unrelated note, Happy New Year.\n\nP.S. I've attached a red packet for Gray Raven's aid in the previous events.\n\nWatanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png
110	1			10	Alpha New Year Mail	α	*The following is a message forcibly left in Babylonia's Command System*\n\nHeard your human New Year is here, eh? There were explosions and commotion near the settlements yesterday.\nApparently some kind of celebration ritual for a coming year? Even though it isn't 1 Jan.\nReminds me though, before the Golden Age, some Easterners used a slightly different calender, and they based their New Year on that.\n...Humans, humans. How petty.\nDon't even know why you'd celebrate peace with explosions.\nAnd.\n——Guess I'll be watching you and the Gray Ravens this year too.

111	1			11	Hassen New Year Mail	Hassen	Happy New Year, Commandant. My sincerest thanks to you from Babylonia.\nYour contributions and growth did not go unnoticed. We could not have achieved so much without talented and hardworking individuals like you.\nPlease rest well in this period of time. I'll be looking forward to your performance in the future.\n\nI send to you my deepest regards and thanks through this mail of mine. Every line is written with my truest blessings. Thank you for your effort this year. Let's break the record and keep the torch going next year! I wish for your good health and that everything goes your way.\n\nP.S. This isn't an email template.

112	1			12	Celica New Year Mail	Celica	Dear Gray Raven's commandant:\n\nHappy New Year.\nOn the very first day of the New Year, I had to overtime at the bridge after receiving warnings about explosives. But when I got there, the supposedly broken holo-display was magically fixed.\nAnyway, Babylonia suffered no actual losses, but somehow, I still had to overtime at the bridge. You can imagine how happy I was.\nThe others from Babylonia must have already given you their New Year blessings, right? Don't forget to respond to them.\nOh, but don't take President Hassen's mail too seriously. I even told him not to use early Golden Age styled greetings and such... He's just not with the times, that old man.\nWhen you receive this mail though, your holidays should be about over. Even though the New Year holidays are all about rest and recreation, please don't forget that they are to prepare you for the coming hardships.\nSo don't forget the good times you had in the holiday, and get ready to work hard this year!\nAgain, Commandant, Happy New Year. Babylonia and the World Government is grateful for your hard work and contributions.\n\nFrom Celica at the Babylonia Bridge\nAnd all of Babylonia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png

117	1		2022/3/2 2:00	19	Gift from Nanami	Nanami	Open it and for a round chocolate ball. Everything seems fine except for its smell that is totally different from normal chocolates. What ingredients did Nanami add to it?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png
118	1		2022/3/2 2:00	20	Gift from Watanabe	Watanabe	 Open it for an exquisite handmade chocolate. Its layer seems to have been damaged slightly because of careless transportation, but its taste remains the same. 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png
119	1		2022/3/2 2:00	21	Gift from Karenina	Karenina	 Open it and for chocolate balls that look normal but, in fact, contain a large amount of popping candies. It tastes spicy, winey and sour and gives an unforgettable mouthfeel. 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png
120	1		2022/3/2 2:00	22	Gift from α	α	 Open it and for handmade chocolates in slightly rough shape. Because fresh cream is hard to find on the ground, it has been replaced by coconut milk to bring out a totally new flavor. 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png

96000012	1		2022/3/2 2:00	27	Gift from Vera	Vera	Open it for a thorny and surprisingly spicy piece of chocolate. Pungency is a type of pain. How on earth did she manage to spice up chocolate? Must be a trade secret.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png

10000	1			13	Sophia New Year Mail	Sophia	 Commandant, Happy New Year, Gong Xi Fa Cai...!\n\nIs that how they say it? Changyu wasn't messing with me, right?\nAnyway, Jamilah said in her letters that we should greet people important to us in the New Year. Apparently, blessings sent in this period of time are most likely to come true.\nSo, I am hoping that you, Commandant... can be healthy for the coming year.\nJamilah wrote that on her mail to me, so... I know it must be a blessing.\nWhen I asked Jamilah,   "So what happens after the year after?"  \nJamilah replied,   "Then you need only repeat your blessing."  \nSo, the next New Year, I will still be here giving your blessings.\n\nBest,\nSophia 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png
10001	1			14	Chrome New Year Mail	Chrome	 Dear Gray Raven's Commandant,\n\nI have received news that Kamui has spent an entire night at Gray Raven's recreation room yesterday.\nSince Kamui was on his own in the Strike Hawk base yesterday, coupled with the New Year occasion, I had presumed that he would have more fun over at Gray Raven's, which led to this oversight of mine. He must have caused immense trouble, and I would like to apologize for that.\nWe have completed many missions together with Gray Raven, but due to time constraints, I have not been able to converse with you thoroughly. I have a lot I wish to learn from you, be it squad management, or tactical commanding. So do forgive me for asking you this favor; if you were to have the time, I would like to talk with you more.\nFrom my understanding, a New Year is a potpourri of gratitude to the past, as well as expectations for the future. It is an important event, so please allow me to send you my greetings.\nStrike Hawk has been in your care for the past year. Let us look out for each other in the future as well.I will gladly be waiting for your commands, as always.\nHappy New Year.\n\nChrome 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png

I was worried that you won't pick up the receiver.	I've been analyzing Gray Raven's battle logs.	It looks like those special Corrupted have been giving you a hard time.

Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I've already uploaded today's battle data analysis report onto the system. Once we've collected enough data, I'll hand in a Construct refinement report to the Council.	Upgrading a Construct's frame needs to be done with extreme caution, and requires constant optimization and fine-tuning. It's not something that can be done in a day, but it's definitely not meaningless.	This is the end of today's report... By the way, I found out that today is a celebration in the west back in the Golden Age where... people gave gifts to those dear to them.	Don't get me wrong, I just think that celebrations are a core part of humanity, and for a certain someone to miss out on this important event would be... unfortunate.	Which is why, in order to make sure you don't miss out, I'll... always be here by your side, celebration or not. Happy Valentine's, KURONAME.	3					
801	Valentine's Message: Liv	7101		55	9001	Happy Valentine's Day, Liv.

It's the day of love!	Back in the Golden Age, people on Earth would give chocolates to the people they love, and the streets were filled with happy couples.	...I feel happy just thinking about it. I hope the world will be filled with love again once we reclaim Earth.	I wanted to experience it too, so I made some chocolates...	If it's not too much, will you accept these, Commandant?	3					
802	Valentine's Message: Kamui	7102		56	9001	Happy Valentine's Day.	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy Valentine's Day! I read that on Valentine's Day, you confessed your love. In the visual nov... I mean, the information I found! Valentine's Day is the day you spend with the most important person in your life!	And to me, that person is, of course, you, Commandant! Am I your most important person too, Commandant? I am, right? Right?	Hehe, anyway, I've prepared Valentine Serum chocolate for you! I've put tons of sugar in it. Nothing says Valentine's Day like it, right?	If you have time... could you come to my room tonight... I found a fighting game popular during the Golden Age! You're gonna love it! We can play it all night long!		3					
803	Valentine's Message: Lucia	7103		57	9001	I like Lucia too. Happy Valentine's Day.	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, for all the times we've gone through, thank you for your leadership and guidance... Why did I say these things?	...According to the information of Golden Age festivals, today is the day where people expressed their feelings to their beloved with chocolate as a gift. Is it correct?	I see, so the information is true... You haven't misunderstood. Commandant is no doubt the one I like.	I've prepared hand-made chocolates for you. But I'm not... very familiar with this. I promise I will work harder on it, Commandant.	Happy Valentine's Day, Commandant.	3					
804	Valentine's Message: Nanami	7104		58	9001	Thank you.	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Hey hey! It's Nanami! Commandant, do you know what is today?	Yep! It's Valentine's Day! Do you feel your heart is racing a bit faster?	Speaking of Valentine's Day, chocolate is the thing we definitely can't miss!	Ms. Celica said if there is a very very important person to you, you have to make a very very yummy chocolate as a present. So Nanami has spent a whole night... or two days... a long time anyway, to make this!	You have to enjoy it slowly! Nanami won't allow you to swallow it in only one bite!	3					
805	Valentine's Message: Bianca	7105		59	9001	Happy Valentine's Day, Bianca.	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time, Commandant of Gray Raven.	According to the database, today is a vital western festival during the Golden Age, Valentine's Day.	On this day, people used to make a chocolate that contained their feelings and give it to the person who was important to them.	If you don't mind, please accept this. I don't know if you like sweets or not... but I hope you will like it.	...Happy Valentine's Day, KURONAME.	3

Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	What? I couldn't care less about this boring festival.	But, well, since you look forward to that, I've prepared chocolates for you, just because I don't want to let you down.	Hmph, they're not exquisite, but I'm sure they will impress you!			3

Happy Valentine's Day! On this day, what cannot be missed is chocolate!	Hehe... Look! Special chocolate made by me! The proportion of sugar, milk and cocoa is 1:2:4, which is a golden formula showed in Golden Age movies! Also I've used solidified serum as stuffing!	By the way, this serum is slightly different. After all... we've shared some mutual secrets, right?	What? Have I tasted it before? How could I taste it before you do? It's a big gift to KURONAME!		3					
808	Valentine's Message: Watanabe	7108		62	9001	Happy Valentine's Day!	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	BZZZZ—Can you hear me? The signal here's a bit unstable... What's with that face? You worried about me? As you can see, there's nothing to worry about. I'm fine.	This is for you, made with raw dark chocolate and Serum. I used to eat this kind of chocolate in the army all the time to refresh myself.	Yeah, I made it. What? It's not that hard to make chocolate... Why am I giving you chocolate? Do you really need me to explain?	Happy Valentine's Day. I'll be waiting for you outside Oasis later. You're worried about me, right? Then come see for yourself that I'm fine.		3

Happy Valentine's Day.		3

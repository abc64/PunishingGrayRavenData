800	Valentine's Message: Lee	7100		55		Happy Valentine's Day, Lee.	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I've already uploaded today's battle data analysis report onto the system. Once we've collected enough data, I'll hand in a Construct refinement report to the Council.	Upgrading a Construct's frame needs to be done with extreme caution. The process requires constant optimization and fine-tuning. It's not something that can be done in a day, but the wait is worthwhile.	This is the end of today's report... By the way, I found out that today is a celebration in the west back in the Golden Age where... people gave gifts to those dear to them.	Don't get me wrong, I just think that celebrations are a core part of humanity, and for a certain someone to miss out on this important event would be... unfortunate.	Which is why, in order to make sure you don't miss out, I'll... always be here by your side, celebration or not. Happy Valentine's, KURONAME.	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, today is a very important day in the Golden Age western culture, do you know what it is? It's the day of love!	Back in the Golden Age, people on Earth would give chocolates to the people they love, and the streets were filled with happy couples.	...I feel happy just thinking about it. I hope the world will be filled with love again once we reclaim Earth.	I wanted to experience it too, so I made some chocolates...	If it's not too much, will you accept these, Commandant?	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

I read that on Valentine's Day, you confessed your love. In the visual nov... I mean, the information I found! Valentine's Day is the day you spend with the most important person in your life!	And to me, that person is, of course, you, Commandant! Am I your most important person too, Commandant? I am, right? Right?	Hehe, anyway, I've prepared Valentine Serum chocolate for you! I've put tons of sugar in it. Nothing says Valentine's Day like it, right?	If you have time... could you come to my room tonight... I found a fighting game popular during the Golden Age! You're gonna love it! We can play it all night long!		1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59
803	Valentine's Message: Lucia	7103		58		I like Lucia too. Happy Valentine's Day.	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, for all the times we've gone through, thank you for your leadership and guidance... Why did I say these things?	...According to the information of Golden Age festivals, today is the day where people expressed their feelings to their beloved with chocolate as a gift. Is it correct?	I see, so the information is true... You haven't misunderstood. Commandant is no doubt the one I like.	I've prepared hand-made chocolates for you. But I'm not... very familiar with this. I promise I will work harder on it, Commandant.	Happy Valentine's Day, Commandant.	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

It's Nanami! Commandant, do you know what day it is today?	Yep! It's Valentine's Day! Do you feel your heart is racing a bit faster?	Speaking of Valentine's Day, chocolate is the thing we definitely can't miss!	Ms. Celica said if there is a very very important person to you, you have to make a very very yummy chocolate as a present. So Nanami has spent a whole night... or two days... a long time anyway, to make this!	You have to enjoy it slowly! Nanami won't allow you to swallow it in only one bite!	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59
805	Valentine's Message: Bianca	7105		60		Happy Valentine's Day, Bianca.	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time, Commandant of Gray Raven.	According to the database, today is a vital western festival during the Golden Age, Valentine's Day.	On this day, people used to make chocolates that contained their feelings and give it to the person who was important to them.	If you don't mind, please accept this. I don't know if you like sweets or not... but I hope you will like it.	...Happy Valentine's Day, KURONAME.	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	What? I couldn't care less about this boring festival.	But, well, since you look forward to that, I've prepared chocolates for you, just because I don't want to let you down.	Hmph, they're not exquisite, but I'm sure they will impress you!			1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Happy Valentine's Day! On this day, what cannot be missed is chocolate!	Hehe... Look! Special chocolate made by me! The proportion of sugar, milk and cocoa is 1:2:4, which is a golden formula showed in Golden Age movies! Also I've used solidified serum jelly as stuffing!	By the way, this serum is slightly different. After all... we've shared some mutual secrets, right?	What? Have I tasted it before? How could I taste it before you do? It's a big gift to KURONAME!		1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	BZZZZ—Can you hear me? The signal here's a bit unstable... What's with that face? You worried about me? As you can see, there's nothing to worry about. I'm fine.	This is for you, made with raw dark chocolate and Serum. I used to eat this kind of chocolate in the army all the time to refresh myself.	Yeah, I made it. What? It's not that hard to make chocolate... Why am I giving you chocolate? Do you really need me to explain?	Happy Valentine's Day. I'll be waiting for you outside Oasis later. You're worried about me, right? Then come see for yourself that I'm fine.		1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Speaking of which, why do I still have to work today?! Am I not eligible? Don't you think I should have a day off?	Whatever, I've finished my work. How about I go have some fun at your dormitory? Don't tell President Hassen!	Well, I'll go get some balloons and candies. See you later!		2	2	2020/6/1 0:00	2020/6/1 23:59

I've heard that today is the day people express their most heartfelt feelings. I... Strike Hawk has been in your care the whole time, so I would like to express my thanks today.	I have prepared a little something. I hope you'd like it.	I wasn't sure what type of chocolate you might prefer, so I've prepared different types and flavors. I hope you find one that you like.Well, then... Happy Valentine's Day, KURONAME.	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Today's Valentine's, you'd know, won't you?	Hah. I know. You're expecting something... special on a day like this, aren'tcha?	Something like... This piece of chocolate, a piece that's so sweet that it hurts?	Ahaha. Take it. When you pop it in your mouth, don't forget who granted you this pain.		1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

Took you long enough. Well, Gray Raven Commandant, you know what day it is.	Yep. The day to show your feelings to important ones. Kamui's been nagging me on all day, ignoring the guy wasn't an option.	Here. Take this. Guess you'd expected something like this. I've tried several ways of making it and there's been quite a few failed products, but eating them up was kinda fun.	Valentine? Nah, I'm not interested in calling it this way or whatever.	Unlike that guy, I know what I want. I wouldn't sully such an important matter in such a petty way.	1	2	2022/2/13 0:00	2022/2/16 23:59

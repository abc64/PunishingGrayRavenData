101	Lee: Palefire	301			9001	I got it, Lee.	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I found this flower during one of the missions. After looking up the database, I realized it was from the same family as the one you gave me.	Seeing this flower...made me think of someone. Such coincidence was an extremely rare event, statistically.	To me, it was of significant value for research... I preserved it, so I could give it to the person it led me to.	According to the data from Golden Age, flowers had a language of their own. So...here's my reply to you.		1	2
102	Lucia: Lotus	302			9001	Let's talk about something you enjoy.	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, everybody told me to come here because I got a gift from you. What did they mean?	Are you trying to tell me something? Sorry I can't hear you, you're stuttering quite a bit.	Just say it. I'll remember everything you say. Anything.			1	2
103	Liv: Eclipse	303			9001	No problem. I'm glad you like it.	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, I planted this rose myself...	Sorry that I never told you about this. I just wanted to give you a surprise today...	But I never thought that Commandant would be the first to give me a flower.	Thank you... I'm so happy.		1	2
104	Bianca: Zero	304			9001	It feels great to understand you.	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Commandant, as a leader, you should manage your work-life balance.	Seeing your white rose reminded me of what other team members said about this date.	"The date was only a homophone... Still, everyone wanted to spend that day with their Mr. or Mrs. Right..."	So I wrote these numbers on the gift box in the hope that this flower could bring you my sincere prayers and wishes.		1	2
105	Nanami: Storm	305			9001	Thanks... Let me put on my goggles first.	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Oooh? FOR ME?	Nanami's so glad! I wish Commandant can be as happy as Nanami!	Let Nanami see... Ahah, there it is!	Ta-da! Take it, Commandant! It's one of Nanami's best stuff!		1	2
106	Kamui: Bastion	306			9001	I will not forget.	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant, you copy? This is Kamui from an encrypted private channel. Make sure you listen to this! *Beep—*	Hey, Commandant, you busy? It's been a while since we last spoke!	Today is the day of love! You sent me flowers, didn't you? I'm the only one to receive your gift of love, right?	I'm so happy! Commandant, I've got something for you too! See, I went to the park and picked the most beautiful rose there!	Sure. Will you come to me on this day every year? It's a deal then! I'll always be waiting for you!	1	2
107	Karenina: Blast	307			9001	Yeah, I'm free.	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I knew you would be writing those reports in the office. Hey, you don't have anything on, do you?	Good...	Why are you sitting on my sofa all of a sudden?	I sit where I want to sit!	By the way... You're free tonight, aren't you? I'll assume you are if you don't reply!	1	2
108	Watanabe: Nightblade	308			9001	It's a promise then.	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Morning, Commandant. How's work? I just...got your gift.	Such a gift on such a day... Are you trying to tell me something?	Anyway, I can feel your passion... Just remember to check your mailbox later.	If you like it, I'll take you to the sea of flowers the next time you come to Oasis.		1	2
109	Lucia: Dawn	309			9001	I'll try to become the best Commandant too.	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, here's my gift for you in return. I'm not very good at this, so please forgive me if you don't like it...	But I will keep trying... To become your weapon that can cut through all the obstacles, and...to become the best Construct in your mind.				1	2
110	Liv: Lux	310			9001	I'll be with you.	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, you don't have to do this.	I love the flowers, but what I really want is...	To have you by my side.			1	2
111	Lee: Entropy	314			9001	I like it a lot, thanks.	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I found this rose in some ruins during a mission long ago.	It was so beautiful. According to the database, on certain important dates, people in the Golden Age would give such flowers...to their important ones.	I recorded all its data, including the angle of every single petal, in my M.I.N.D. so I could restore it. It is the only rose I have stored in my M.I.N.D... And I hope you can see it too.			1	2
112	Liv: Luminance	312			9001	Alright.	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thanks for your rose. I love it.	Actually... I have a little surprise for you too.	Can you come to the deck of Babylonia later?			1	2
113	Kamui: Tenebrion	311			9001	I'll take good care of this.	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, you busy? Mind if I spare some of your time?	I got your gift, so I was wondering if I should do something to return your favor. How about I give myself to you... Joking! Hehe.	Anyway, I've got a little surprise for you! Don't tell anyone else!	Make sure you take good care of it! I want to stay with Commandant forever just like this gift.		1	2
114	Karenina: Ember	313			9001	What about a hug?	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	You should expect to see me today when you gave me that.	So what's with this stupid outfit? You look miserably clueless!	Whatever, just give me your hand. Don't you know how to hold hands?	Wait a sec, don't grab me all of a sudden! Don't use so much force, you fool!		1	2
115	Nanami: Pulse	315			9001	Thanks... Wait, what?	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	I'm back! It's a me! Na☆na☆mi!	Why didn't you tell Nanami earlier!? Do you know how difficult it is to take this out?	I had to return to the lab within 15 sec, smash—I mean open the liquid nitrogen container, and rush back here!	Let me think... You shall have a one-day date with Nanami as punishment!		1	2
116	α	316			9001	That's a bit difficult...	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Are you waiting for me...? Doesn't seem so. Fine.	I never thought you would care about such a date in Babylonia.	Honestly, that gift of yours wasn't very useful. In other words, I didn't like it.	If you are ever going to give me something again... Just pack yourself up and come to the Ascendant's base.		1	2
117	Watanabe: Astral	317			9001	I want to see you too.	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Commandant, it's been a while. How have you been?	I found a rose in an abandoned stronghold while patrolling. I didn't know why, but you were the first thing that came to my M.I.N.D... So I brought it back in the hope that you would like it.	Then I saw your gift. You were thinking exactly what I was thinking, weren't you?	I have put your rose in a vase. Hope I can see you before it withers, if possible.		1	2
118	Ayla: Brilliance	318			9001	I'm ready!	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	Happy May 20th, Commandant! I didn't expect to get a gift from you.	Ah... What I mean is, I'm actually very happy.	Because it was the first time that I got such a valuable gift. Well, Commandant, are you ready for my "real gift"?			1	2
119	Bianca: Veritas	319			9001	Yeah, be there soon.	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	Thanks for your gift, Commandant.	By the way, "520 Days With You" just hit the theaters today. Let's watch it together.	And... There's something I want to tell you too.			1	2
120	Sophia: Silverfang	320			9001	Thank you, Sophia.	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	So this is true...	This is for you.	I heard today was a day to exchange gifts with important ones.	I spent a lot of time preparing this.		1	2
121	Chrome: Arclight	321			9001	Come to me.	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Incoming communication from Strike Hawk—Chrome's dedicated channel.	Commandant of Gray Raven, please, allow me to call you by your name this time.	KURONAME, I have received your gift. I don't know if I have understood this correctly...	Speaking of roses, I wonder if you have ever heard of "Unter der Rose"—	I know this may not be allowed, but I want to be there with you.	1	2

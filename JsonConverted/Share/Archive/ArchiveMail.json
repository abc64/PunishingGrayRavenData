I have already prepared all the possible documents you might require, and you need only sign your name on them. I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call \"Lunar New Year\".\\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together. Your command decisions have brought us victory and hope.\\nYour efforts were not unrecognized by us.\\nWell... It all feels quite new and awkward writing it this way.\\nBut anyhow, good work for the last year, Commandant.\\nHappy New Year.\\n\\nLee",
